If Wynne is serious about ' deeply troubling' and her intentions to reform, she would fire Naqvi and the current solicitor general plus a lot of officials like Deputies and ADMs That is the only way to send the message clear and loud.
mjsp: your comment of course has nothing to do with the subject here, the price of books; a formula for that has been in place for 30 years in Europe and works successfully
The Sheldon Cooper 'pre-coitus' contract. Hahaha. If a chick flops on her back and starts taunting a guy, she may or may not get sex. Is it rape if she has an orgasm too?
We should shut this country down because a reserve with a population of 200 or so thinks a pipeland 200 miles from there town should be negotiated with them first... get real.
Cap, the guy in Montreal was a 72-year old former prof. The guy in T.O. was an 18-year old kid with a ball cap. Obviously, the kid in the cap and holding a knife was a much greater threat than the old guy loaded to the gills with firearms.
Name me one country that didn't run a deficit during the recession? Or would massive cutbacks would have liked to have seen in order to not run a deficit?
concise. correct. much appreciated.
And because Democratic superdelegates were prematurely awarded to Hillary Rodham Clinton instead of Bernie Sanders. Insider's game, anyone?
We should be thankful that Chretien had the good sense to to get us involved in the Iraq war.
Insightful post.

Well, A-Chord, your erroneous post works really well here, because it proves how wrong well-meaning, "best intentioned" people can be.
I don't think we have received anything approaching 'complete and accurate information' related to Mr. Trump... or at least we cannot tell as he reverses his statements every few minutes.
I keep track easily myself. It used to be every 5 years, then 2, now 1. Always around my birthday.
No, Black, it is Rob Ford that is, unfortunately for us Torontonians, totally predictable.
Nor would it been hushed up had the gangs attacked men.

Excellent response John. I also noted some misleading statements but you cover them all.
Sounds like a lot of guys here. Want to narrow it down?
Draining more rivers to keep the main problem growing won't help.

Let me understand this properly. The two of you claim you never read the Globe anymore. So you're commenting without reading the article ?
Remember when he called Atlantic Canada a 'culture of defeat.'
The most important thing that this world needs is a smaller, sustainable human population. Nature will eventually have its way, with us or without us.

Here's a couple of more terms the Harper Youth can use for 'enemies'; citizens and taxpayers.
Fanone, In 20 years we could be looking at a desert and ask how we let it happen.
Interesting and revealing. Thanks. Strikes me that these well to do non citizens are the direct result of the original self centered yuppie thinking from the eighties.
Harper is bully and a coward completely lacking in diplomatic skills. That's why.
Imagine if the media made a big deal out of a female politicians hair.
Is Lysiane talking of herself when focusing on Lone wolves?
Just don't forget 9/11.
There is a rather big difference between predicting the future and having the future arrive and seeing if the prediction became true.
The question is - who is payin his tab at Harvard.
The Supreme Court is SUPPOSED to be unchecked and free of political interference. As for the media, it depends on which corporate conglomerate controls that particular news source.
The difference is that those folks are not going to give Milewski an interview. At that level you have to take what you can get.
At union hall.
Only one party has policies that address the future with a realistic sense of the coming challenges and how to meet them in a way that is logical and sustainable. The Green Party. The other three are stuck playing politics.
Interesting that you should mention the Project for a New American Century. Established, I think, in 1997 and actively promoted/promoting American military supremacy
Every time I go to the city I feel angry. Most people born in the lower mainland cannot afford to live there anymore. I often wonder where do the restaurant and store employees live. Most people I know sold and left long ago.
"... as long as it doesn't hurt anyone." That's the key phrase. Why do we allow misogynistic cultural practices?
Truth, Bush was the lead actor, others wrote, directed and produced the blockbuster.
I guess it depends on which side of the which side of, 'The Looking Glass', yu be on.
The hat fits doesn't it.
sounds like your a hater
I like it. Sorry pros this kid did a great job.
sirencall, You should read up on your man-God Turdeau Sr. before spouting off. Nobody prorogued like he did. Maybe you should get your own history accurate.
.. Good News: Your Claim Is Unbelievable ..// ..
The Americans get it. The EU gets it. Canada? Not so much. Nobody cares what's happening to our research and higher education except the people who work in it. It's really a sad state of affairs. Ignorance is bliss, I guess.
I think you can get an audio recording of the book.
Putin is the best world leader going. He is the leader of Russia, not a bought puppet like Obama that takes his marching orders from foreign billionaires and special interest groups. I like Putin more than any politician on the Canadian scene.
Wrap it up then if you can't handle the risk.
I dunno. Just because you 'apply' for a job doesn't mean you'll get it. And if you are 'pushy' about it sometimes you end up being 'pushed out the door'. There's a fine line between being 'assertive' and being 'a pain-in-the-you-know-what'.
IGS3: You should pose this question to Chimurenga, an Alberta contributor to Rabble, as he supports the NDP and uses the term himself.
I'm no fan of this government, but this is a step in the right direction. Though the mutilation of all children's genitals should be a considered barbaric.
At least she has me reading about the topic. Maybe you could do the same.
I would have said pile.
Best comment yet. Thank you, Bob.
People of Canada should fight for their country. Elections are next year, do we have the right candidate?
So what do you think about your guy declaring on this morning's John Oakley show that he's prepared to run the city all by himself?
Plus 8, Bingo!
Or the Liberals could have taken the initiative themselves??
There are peaceful ways to tackle an invading army by making things as much of a headache for them as is peacefully possible. Had we not waged WW1 we may not have had to wage WW2 as there would have been no national pride issue for the Germans.
Speaking of sex, not getting any? You seem a lil touchy :)
"Obama is not a good President!" Umm... is there something in my post that claims he is?

$90,000 for less than 10 months of work? I would be lining up to teach too. And doing the extra year. Sorry, no sympathy in this corner.
Good one. Humour and insight are two sides of the same coin.
All good points. Anyone who expected real change from the Liberals was fooled. They should have voted NDP or Green.
'Yankee doodle dandy'! Bang on!
Could we have the figures on how many jobs Sophie created by wearing those dresses?
Simplistic to the point of void in economic reality.
yes, democratic 'debate' -- what a waste of taxpayers' money. bring on the autocracy!
It wasn't a Liberal landslide because the progressive vote was split among four parties. In a hypothetical two-way race either Trudeau or Mulcair would have handily beaten Harper and the Conservatives.
and is wandering, unbridled among the populace.
But he's talking about you.
Is this the fake James O'Keefe video debunked elsewhere?
Not racist when existing Canadian Chinese feel the same way as other Canadians about the foreigners impact on the VanRE market.
We go halfway around the world to get refugees out of deplorable camps and yet we continue to fund and support the reserve model which is barely different. Sadly, more money isn't going to make their lives any better. It's not the 1700's anymore.
The answer is simple. Your referendum result wasn't adequate to negotiate secession.
My last sentence reads: Life without parole is a guarantee they will never ever be released from prison. And I don't have a problem with that. The new legislation doesn't recommend life without parole for all convicted murders.
Whenever someone hauls out the 'I'm praying for this or that' it makes me cringe and look on the speaker as being too stupid for words. If prayer worked here would be no need for science ( medicine).
No. The auto industry will just switch over to electric cars.
Actually, I can't fault your logic there at all. As a person who is at home in several cultures I had no idea how important 'cultural identity' really is to a lot of people. Evereybody is different in that regard I guess.
Well, there aren't many larger men for him to take on, are there?
Yes, a child getting their sex ed from Youtube would be ideal.??????????????????????????
Non-sense at it's best !
Hitler expected England to just roll over in 1940. Jean-Claude Juncker expected England to just roll over on Thursday. Both were wrong, and both are tyrants.

Uh, that's like saying you might not be the CEO but you can be the CEO's wife. Not actually empowering to women.

If Grandma was a civic employee taking voting directions from a labour union, she deserves some blame for being so easily conned into bankrupting her children's cities.
Oh please. Your comment is nothing more than a sock puppet speaking point. From the looks of it, Trudeau didn't debate it within his own party.
What's he going to do should he attend the meeting?
You're right - The US lied its way into destabilizing Iraq. Now Steve gets another crack at spending our blood and treasure in this morass. Someone should ask what his position is on Greater Kurdistan.

Joannie likes the 1700s. Back in the good old days when you were paid in coal and had a vacation day once a year. In her small mind, if one person has no benefits, nobody should have benefits. If one person is blind, lets poke everyone's eyes out.

Stand by our allies and do what? Continue the bombing? It hasn't been effective so how do we 'stand by our allies' to win this war?
ALL of these measures can be looked at without raising Senate reform, the constitution and referenda. Federal electoral law is something distinct.
You blame Dix for his campaign strategy. He is not responsible for campaign strategy. His campaign manager Topp at the very least was in on the scam to make sure Christy won. Dix is just an innocent bystander.

Dr Barry Sears, author of the Zone diet, was years ahead of everybody but nobody wants to give him any credit. His thesis that the hormone insulin is the most important factor in weight gain and heart disease is now recognized.

Greg, on the contrary honest discussion is all that I'm after as opposed to insults. I take it that you are not interested in being honest.
Shouldn't you check to see if Trudeau will reverse it before you vote?
I meant to thumbs up, but fully agree although I hit the thumbs down by accident.

LOL. PET continually ranks in the top 5 of Canada's best PMs!
There is no statistical evidence that extreme weather events are increasing. All there is are claims. Claims seem to hold a lot of weight in the G&M, but they are just that... claims.

It was news to me that Sir John A. Macdonald promoted starvation and genocide.
I don't think there's any excuse for the behavior in those videos, Whineritis.
Absolutely muscle!! Neither Mulcair nor Trudeau could negotiate for Canada since they're from the secessionist province. If a Quebecer can negotiate for Canada I want a Manitoban to negotiate for Quebec.

Progressive, his is referring to Ford's claim that cutting the car registration fee (income to the city) is counted as a saving. Saving is when you cut money that is being spent, not money that is being paid to you.

Hardly. I read and commented on that particular article before you did, and have an excellent memory - and after all it was only three days ago. Not much of a stretch. And yes, I suppose it's an achievement, like almost catching a big fish.

Never. Progressives have a double standard.
Oh no! The gravy train fairy tale applied to the UN! Go Ford/Harper Nation!
Aaljam, and last time I checked Mike Harris isn't running either. In fact, he is a lot more removed than Dalton is.
Excellent editorial!
'This is a man who has caused pain and embarrassment for his family.'There have been allegations that some of that pain was physical.

There should be a warning at the start of this article. 'Reader, you are going to need a large serving of mustard to help you swallow this load of baloney.'
I don't agree with this (IMHO and all that, it ought to be done at the high school level) and, sorry, my comments do not exhibit 'the ugliness that ignorance produces'. I'll leave the irony of your comment to the reader to contemplate.
And I have to admire Alceste's fortitude for taking on that bunk at all, because as (s)he said - it is near impossible to know where to start.

Why was Ford stupid? Is being responsible with taxpayers money stupid? He got elected because of his policies. He got into trouble because of his addiction.
There have always been many right-wingers among 'regular working people.' (support for Rob Ford as a case in point) Social class doesn't determine political ideology.
Nice to have a different apocolypse story... I was getting somewhat bored with the usual climate change stuff.

How about the rights of working Canadians who pay $14 BILLION a year in funding they get with no accountability?

Just FYI, the book is called 'Party of One'.Merchant of Venom is just a name that author Harris has called Harper. And, to be fair, years ago it was the well known nickname for comedian Don Rickles, so it's not like Harris made it up.
Not fair to diabetics.

The road to nowhere?
Nope, nice trying though.
Not to mention John I Love Harper Ibittson.
Who knows? But it's certainly a good argument for that independent investigation.
And those fossil fuels will be us!
I would rather step on red hot nails than rely on anything from Levant.
Does this new era of niceness mean there won't be large groups of protesters blocking highways and turning our attention to death and destruction in far-off places?
I think the budget for Indian Affairs is something like $11B annually !
"nice white Jewish colonists" Canada has a history of significant antisemitism and you carry on that tradition. It's as socially acceptable as the rampant anti-American bigotry is.
I have never read such rot. Why does the globe print this ? Maybe the Star but not the globe. She has no idea of what she talks.
Eva Bartlett is a Canadian 'journalist' that is on RT( RoTflol)!That's why no one has ever heard of her. Hope she sold her integrity for many $US, don't be taking no rubles!
Only a person who is a conspiracy theorist would not find the humour in the column.
Mr. Martin, comments such as 'circle the wagons' and 'natives getting restless', however innocent, are racist and denigrate the First Nations people of this land.
Ontario can't survive another Liberal majority government at Queen's Park ! Thats the real issue.
The ignorati continue to challenge the findings of the world's best climate scientists. If they were harmless, I would simply laugh, but their nonsense is poisoning the well of rational discussion of these critical issues
best2 a whole lot of them are leaving, and when Mandela dies, a whole lot more will join them.
Ah, another sensible, intelligent comment! Thank you.
Yes I can nothought. Hitler practiced Keynesian economics. I support Keynesian economics. By your logic I must support anything Hitler says.
The biggest threat to democracy in this country is the Oil-industry-captured Conservative Party. This article is just another attempt by those clowns to attack and undermine the independence of the judiciary in a democracy.
A potential leader of Canada that is a terrorist apologist isn't newsworthy. Get with the program.
This is not about reason, logic - it's about warm and fuzzy FEELINGS.
Yes and, after about 35 years, employers need to give Canadians a real raise.
Well that article was a waste of electrons.
Anyone who doesn't know the difference between accept and except isn't worth listening to . . .
Not what I said. You need to stop replying to what you think you read. Get back to me when you can respond to what I actually siad.
There will have to be an amnesty when it is legalized.......empty the jails, drop the paroles and give people back their lives, families and livelihoods.
Platitudes are easy to come by.
hahahahahahaha .....
scary, very scary
You say people aren't interested? You've got 1000 comments so far. I think I'll get down to Timmie's and stand in line.
Oh please Big Brother tell me what to eat!~
i'm worried for the mental health of the editor who wrote this, they called economics a science. someone in the office please go and check on him/her.
I love this woman and her writings -everything she pens confirms that all that I think I know about modern North American Islam is true
Better to be open and honest than lucky.
I agree that they are not interested for many of the reasons you've outlined but also for the reason that all they can hope to get is 'Provincial' status which Quebec already has.
Oh come on- we all saw Angry Earl Cowan!
Once we take the word 'God' out of the Canadian Constitution, you might have an argument. What's that they say about glass houses?
It really is too bad that Putin went and invaded Ukraine and started all of this. Please tell him he's been bad and needs to return home and stay away from the neighbours.
I'm holding my vote close right now. I WANT to judge her for being a part of that cabinet, but it's not the pert move. Andrea chnaged her tune an awful lot; during the teachers strikes.^ Her integrity, in my eyes, dropped huuuuuuge....and quickly.
or a dictionary .....
Who can you trust? How about Steve Paikin?
I hate guns, but I am also an historian and I'm compelled to say that this column is ... um, sweepingly inaccurate.
Sounds like propaganda ramping up to support Harper in his decision to pull out the rug from under our healthcare system. Wake up sheep!
To get respect you have to earn it and to give it to others. Not all politicians and particularly journalists who spend their time looking for the gotcha and the scandal understand this.
Men behave badly, but men do all sorts of interesting things. The key word is 'DO'. Pretty well everything your eyes will see today is because men did it.
Teaching at the U of T and at Harvard.
As another reply noted, the GG is a toady Harper appointed as a reward for fixing the latestes inquiry into Mulroney's bribe-taking. You'd do better petitioning Prince Charles, who at least has a conscience.
I agree 100% with the readers comment below - simply don't let these guys back in to the country! Simple.
You are absolutely correct!
Toronto elected the CBC building.
Truly well-said by Margaret. There's a vast right wing conspiracy out there squeezing the authenticity, principle and joy out of the world, and Artillery Hillary is the head conspirator.
Harper loves only himself.
Rock Stars....Is there anything they don't know? Homer Simpson
ha! still the G & M will end up 'endorsing' these slime balls come next election.
Not really; 1. Shutting down completely Alberta's oilsands would reduce global emissions by 0.15% (that's fifteen one hundredths of one percent). 2. Shutting down the entire Canadian economy would reduce global emissions by 1.58%.
'Ottawa, of course, has no control over global trends, over pivotal decisions made in our provinces, in foreign capitals, in currency markets.'Even as Ottawa sets records signing sovereignty stealing so-called 'free trade' deals?
Exactly right. If Hillary presses him on specifics pf policy issues, he will discount her by saying 'Yeah, like your detailed policies and those of Obama have worked out for us'
All the things mentioned in the post are true and verifiable. Ignorance runs deeper.
It's been fairly clear for some time--future mathematicians, economists and statisticians of every stripe will need to embrace the study of chaotics and complexity. Easier said than done, however.
And I'm not sure the man they are destroying is Justin Trudeau - I think it's Stephen Harper.
...the center wobbles, but the cranks try to tilt it the 1930ties way....
Quebec language laws are perceived by the Supreme court of Canada, the British monarchy and the rest of the world as fair, necessary and respectfull of everybody. An inspiration for those countries who wish to preserve their identity. Bravo Qu?bec!
The Republicans will not only LOSE with Trump, they will LOSE the Senate and maybe even the House. And deservedly so for letting this pied piper charlatan be on the top of their ticket.
It's now an 'irrelevance' like the Wheat Board. Watch for the PMO announcing its imminent sale to an international consortium. That's Tory creativity, pay foreigners to give away our money.
Meh... its what we have at.What we have is the SRT data and studies of where people go when taking transit from Scraborough. A bit better then what Gee did.
Followed closely by:? 'Iran wants to build an A-Bomb !!and? 'Putin wants to invade the world !!'
Maybe, it will be the Kochpugnicans who are in for the shock.
It's the Conservative Party's fault. Seriously. For not having fielded a more credible leader last two elections. Sadly.
I have a similar queasy feeling - perhaps the end of times are nigh
Cardi B is not black. She even stated herself that she's not black to those identifying her as such
I don't get it. Why would you feel that way?
I have always thought myself a liberal but the more I see of Justin Trudeau the less I can see myself voting liberal.
Well, given this post, I would venture deranged paranoia has to be up there as well.....
Generally people tunnel when they are being sieged and imprisoned. Stop the genocide and it is time to look at basic human rights to move forward in a constructive manner.
If reason is beyond your reach, there is always bigotry.
Called the Whiskey Jack on the other coast too.
Any idea what a neocon is, Sunshine??? Apparently not. It is a prog who has seen the light, my uneducated little friend.
A Bully like the Russian Federation only respect 'Force', so lets not confuse Harper's words on the Sanctions with real action, only the USA has the Force but there current President wants none of that, the World is the West in disaray!
May not be empowering, but it is fun.
It seems that Canadians will let Harper sell us down the river as long as they can have cheap cheese.
The Constitution is boss. And you REALLY hate that, don't you?
It's you who has a problem. So, you're going to deny anyone wearing a hijab, turban, or kippah access to the law? Perhaps you'd like to ban Scotsmen from wearing kilts and women from wearing pants?
Stephen Harper is incapable of addressing the tough questions, he is not world class. He demonstrated this fact in Israel yesterday
It's a marketing term for immigration spin doctors.
Good questions but I believe the most important questions is What do we expect to achieve for Canada and for those being directly affected. The answer is Zero or make things worse - this is all about the propaganda of getting re - elected !
Europe is NOT 'failing Syrian refugees'!
That's not medicine, that's an addiction, and that is bad.
Tony Gazebo, the first step is for you to permanently retire from politics.
True, Robert, but entirely unrelated to the issue at hand.
Trudeau may be a lot of things, but the smartest guy in the room he is not!
Bolt Epistaxis running around stapling this same comment to everything he cannot respond to
Doubt they are that forward-thinking... that's a two step process, they can barely stand!
They came, they landed and they ran out of power.
Actually the interest payment is close to $1 Billion a month! (or 362 dollars per second)http://www.ofina.on.ca/borrowing_debt/debt.htmScroll to the very bottom of the page above.
The former Conservative government had nothing to do with this deal eh?Right? WRONG WRONG WRONG. They had plenty to do with it probably one of Harper's FREE TRADE DEALS he signed plenty of them.
That post is pure malarky and a desperate attempt to argue that the NDP's inexperience and its very weak team would muddle through. Highly unlikely and certainly not worth the risk.
You pal are the one in the bubble with your paranoid fixations and your fantasy that this slimy shyster will be your salvation.
don't let the facts get in the way of a racially tinged emotional argument!
Pretty sad that you identify as a taxpayer and not a citizen.
Love those Umlauts but it actually is 'Anschluss'.
Then maybe people like Donald Trump should stop employing illegal immigrants.
Progressive: I can read French better than Shakespeare. What language did he write in? I sure can't understand it.
Anyone who doesn't see that humanity is in a dark and darkening time has their eyes shut. Anyone who thinks Donald Trump can diminish the darkness has their mind closed. http://thelastwhy.ca/
Your last sentence says it all. It is just a matter of time before this legislation is challenged in the courts and then the current Liberals will experience the same pain the former Conservatives experienced with the SCoC.
I am one of the 1% and I'm happy to pay higher taxes to get my Canada back.
Yes, that's right, this scum allowed everyone to get off the bus and waited for the police to arrive just so he could stab, cut or injure a cop from thirty plus feet away. Either you're delusional or on drugs.
What's the Twittersphere saying? Any word on Pinterest?
And the Amercican sniper who killed an Iraqui mother in her home town of Falluja said what? He was ecstatic.
Wait till Trudeau is done with us before you throw that word regret around.
Harper has found your button.
Glad we cleared that up???
Relevance?
It stinks I tell ya!
Hear, Hear!!!
Canada contains over a third of the world?s boreal forest, one fifth of the world?s temperate rainforest, and a tenth of the total global forest cover. I think doing something about our forest is in everyone's interests.
She & other celebrities bring nothing to the table. I would prefer to hear from legitimate scientists. I would rather hear from NASA scientists than Pee Wee Herman.
I agree with Gundi. I was hopeful at the outset, but since they won their majority, they have descended into farce. Time for Harper to leave as leader of the Conservatives.
There is irony in the fact that Ford was the first municipal politician in a long time that was focused on the taxpayer and it turns out, he's on crack!!
The boy wonder is taking away from child care benefit AND jacking my taxes. I have a big problem with paying for HIS two nannies.
If I am donating say $10,000 to a political party, I will make sure they know where the money came from.
The Conservative Party was obviously Harper, "The Party of One".
Takes one to know one.
http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/series/16 see Fig 3.2Here you find the results from the PISA report and guess what? Canada is second place behind Finland- so, something we must be doing right here!
Is there anything specific you would like to debate? I'm open to an exchange of ideas. Or would you prefer that I just respond to your insults of 'ignorant bigot' with mindless taunts of my own as a substitute to actually discussing issues?
The anonymous trolls are doing their work.
But they voted for Obama expecting big-time government intervention.
I thought 'People' was a plural term. Huh! Who new?
whats a political gulag?
You are assuming Trump is a huckster. His supporters believe differently.
The Natives will now hire a lawyer to sue the Taxpayer for a land claim. The Taxpayer pays the bills of this lawyer. Only in Canada would someone find this as the way forward. Brilliant.
Trudeau Sr. and Chretien had those honours.
Gee, try to win us over with an argument that consists of calling us names? What a silly thing to do.Or maybe you're just a troll.
right... our 1.6% contribution is killing the planet
Makers and Takers, simple as that. You know which side you are on and it starts with a T

Now that is constructive criticism. I don't agree but point well made.
Not a bad idea but Berlin worked, in part, due to the German work ethic and inherent discipline. Are today's Americans up to the task ?
So much better than that column I read in the post last week. Wonder why a certain 'journalist' over there has been so quiet of late ....
Jeez Louise, Her non election was not about sex. It was about the disenfranchisement of middle America. Stop trying to create issues where there aren't.
Just a wee bit off topic Jack.
Wynne Liberals are leftists. Her budget was more than anything the NDP could ever have hoped for. Ontario's day of reckoning is coming. The next four will only bear out the incompetence of this Liberal band of crooks.
One quote from one selected sight is considered by you as being enough proof to justify your position. I doubt you really care about finding the truth. It seems your objective is to find something negative to say about Wente.
Not at all. Do what you want. Just don't try to suggest that a qualified medical professional should feel obliged to take responsibility for your decisions.
How dare you genderize the gendered social construct. 'Women' and 'Men' do not imply gender, but rather how persons choose to identify. /s

Martyrs make good toast.
This law was originally brought in by the liberals decades ago. But for the left wing it fits their paranoid narrative that everything harper is bad, so why let facts get in the way of a good argument.
Don
If we lose our AAA rating, it will be because of overspending. Remember when we had a balanced budget under the previous government and were paying down our national debt? What party was that again?
The voters want spending and welfare. So we get that no matter who is in power. Fall of the Roman Empire.
Why not allow private clinics to exist for this service?
Harper just added 16 bill to our ship building and this rates as bigger news.....
that would involve the IRS forgiving tax debt, which it will never do.
So, 5Tree, you say that those are 'human' and not 'Canadian' values. Then you would happily call the newcomers 'unhuman', but not 'barbaric'. Quite a difference...
Multiculturalism is snake oil. At least Harper isn't selling that.
Very well said. The fact that so many people from around the world want to come here, says it all.
'hard working asians'? Not PC!'...Aircraft, software, computer chips, corn and wheat, even vehicles'...Already invented, dear old delusional chap.

The truth is on your pension plan documents and in the financial statements publicly available for all public sector pension plans, including your own. I suggest that you take your meds.
That's the point. She can't return because her husband, an honest hardworking man, just cannot obtain a Canadian visa. Do you advise that she leave him behind to come back?
Changing the subject...? Compartmentalizing is just another form of cognitive dissonance. Sorry I refuse to debate you any longer. You don't like your 'sacred' things being questioned, that's obvious.
So you're saying that our former PM didn't see any reason to use brains, while our new PM will.
Yes, Charlie. It was wrong to put the Cossacks out of work.
You're a cockroach. look sharp
And you know this how? Oh right- when you are believer what is the point of looking at facts- they only distort the 'TRUTH'
Your post is an inexactitude..............
Professional hecklers then.
They beat your beloved Rush fairies into the R&R hall of fame by a decade with two chords and no hit songs. Complain to the Hall of Fame, most soft rockers do.
Yes.. unbelievably rude
Who is this woman and why is she in G&M debate? Didn't we move on from State religion vs Secularism like a hundred years back? She likes state religion - let her move to Saudi Arabia...
To me accommodation of religion and culture is a Canadian value as enshrined in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
If Trump wins very few Canadians will want to travel to the US.
In one location, according to one report by a reporter with unknown biases.
Step 11 - Move out
Why do you leave out BC ?
The 'middle class' is under severe pressure from right wing incompetence and out right criminal activity. If they vote CON, they must be on drugs.
Oh BTW, I wonder if CLIFFORD ORWIN wouldn't mind doing an article on why he thinks the Globe And Mail are not covering the WikiLeaks email releases regarding Podesta and Clinton?
A lot of the tensions had been around before Obama. Twitter and FB made them more visible.
As long as people consider themselves to be bags of cash rather than citizens, Ford's siren call of 'respect the taxpayer' will continue to have resonance with his constituency.
News flash, Chris Spence resigned. Now, that's the right thing to do.
Imagine the cognitive dissonance if a couple of carloads of gun-toting Black Panthers rolled up to support the occupation.
Oh. My God. That's unbelievable.
So wrong about that. The NDP is complaining to.Its Trudeau's hypocrisy, not the issue itself.
Anyone who aligns themselves with Harper at this point in time needs to have their heads examined.
Just part of the Globe's rehabilitation program. Only neo-conservative ideologues need apply. Thanks for the critique because I would not waste my time reading the article.
Yes Inky - I have been reading much commentary online and I have yet to learn Just what difference the end of the accord will make!
Rhodes scholars were chosen because their parents were well connected; go back through 50 years of Canadians who were chosen and then check their parentage.
Families like ours, Cannot afford to have one parent not working. Subsequently, If my family cannot afford to stay at home, neither can lower income families. This whole thing just doesnt work... it just doesnt....
Trump has held his aspirations for a better America for a very long time. An interesting video historical perspectivehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSM
Agree 100%, especially with this first past the post system we have. We need something that protects us from what we have just gone through the last nine years.
benn, answer my question
And to think that the Globe and Mail endorsed Mr. Harper last election. Please do not do that again in 2015.
Giver them a couple of days to calm down and consult the experts...
LMAO!!! I will try that
- thus spake the rabbit on the bandwagon. the IQ level of this country is going through the floor
What is your actual point? How is that significant?
Margaret is not bigoted at all.....just her choice of words is all that can be misleading. Give her a break, man.
Actually Ontario nuke power cost 2.7 cents a kwh in 2007 according to the WNA while new hydro is 3 times that were there any to build - there isn't. But don't lets facts get in the way of a good rant.
Our health care is socialism too -- but you ripped up your card in protest, you insist on paying full price for your visits to the doctor and the hospital. That is so impressive.
It is only the Left that is intellectually bankrupt.
Coming form a former Liberal candidate and the wife of a former Liberal minister who resigned under an ethical cloud, this article is a bit much! If this is the Globe's idea of balance then I suggest it is considerably off balance.
The haters will hate the Johns and the Janes. Haters always hate. If the religious persons daughter is a prostitute they will be stoned to death.
Better to ship it by train according to you?? Maybe you need to spend some time in Lac Megantic and see the devastation that your ignorance has caused.
He refuses to prescribe BC for ANY reason. That's NOT medical judgment.
Maybe we can create a huge "sense of identity" bureaucracy that we can funnel even more tax dollars into. That'll fix the problem of the odd nutjob slipping through the cracks.
Lets see now. If they go or attempt to go to join ISIS they are a terrorist. If they decide to act while in Canada they are a criminal or they are mentally ill. Funny how that works.
Ha ha! The USA and France couldn't care less about Quebec, other than their financial interests in the province, which will disappear anyway if they separate.
They've joined forces with the evangelicals and climate change deniers. Who knew telling kids fairy tales would lead them to believe that inbreeding somehow produces ruling class genes. No wonder they all hate science so much.
Frightened children such as yourself, 'Clear Thinker' always look for some reason to set their hair on fire and run around in a panic.
'In your effort to balance gender you have given up competency.'I'd love your take on which ministers you believe are 'not competent'. This cabinet is filled with competent and talented people.
At least JT did something. What's Harper's excuse?
You can sue the hell out of them.
I agree. Not really a Hip fan myself, but it is hard not to get caught up in this story. So much bad news and ugliness out there. Nice to celebrate something. Nice change of pace.
Excellent comment, thanks.
Very funny. For a second there, I forgot to be angry.
Only among political junkies and lefties
With harper and gang in power is like bringing the Dark Ages to Canada!
What an 'ignorance is still bliss' solution. Either it's legal or it's not, grey zone laws are ridiculous.
The words 'complexity' and 'Trudeau' should never appear together in the same sentence. The first is a poor descriptor, while the latter wouldn't really know what such a big word means. Hell, he probably can't even spell it.
Hateful and disingenuous articles on Trump :-)Trump didn't get half the kicking he deserves... and 10 years from now he will be conveniently forgotten by his supporters... just like George W Bush.
Gas taxes don't even cover the cost of the roads we drove on for 'free'
Yup. We be as quiet as a church mouse and we'll be safe. Yup.
So bitter. so sour, after all these months. My, that must be gnawing at your insides. Try at Pepto.
Thoughtful article from a childless person. In the long run, for those concerned about the survival of their culture, it is everyone's business.?
How about the responsibility to treat others as your equal? By hiding behind her mask, this woman is deliberately cutting me off from recognizing who she is, and limiting communication.

I don't care if the athletes disagree, I think we should boycott the Sochi Olympics. To hell with the Olympics, it's an exploitive boondoggle, a cash-cow for mega-corporations.
Milt. If that is true, then how come they imprison dissidents and have a population living near the poverty line?
great news for the CBC - now if we could only get Rogers to do the same with the Harpies at the next election...
Yeah Dougie boy, and there's no Muslim tide either. When are you going to stop denying that there are problems in this world and come out of your little cocoon?
The 15% tax helps pay for things like Professor Yu's money from the Canadian Federal Government for $950,000 to study things he likes to study. In China the government locks up Canadians in jail and pays them nothing. Good grief.
"The shallow voter doesn't vote."-----------You realize the dichotomy of your statement don't you? If they didn't vote then they wouldn't be a voter. No wonder Conservatives have been out of power in Ottawa most of the last century.
You really need to familiarize yourself with the concept of 'Charter violation'.
Were any of these to positions that weren't open at the time of the appointment? Please provide some examples.
Holy cow. This just set the anti-KXL movement back 6 months. Every argument is anecdotal with zero evidence or explanation for the rather strong assertions that the author makes. Amateur.

Instead of going with experience and credentials as per Martha Hall-Findlay, the party chose fame and fashion as per Trudeau Jr, you get what you vote for.
That's why I ain't a Catholic no more!!
Our first PM John A Macdonald was an alcoholic too. He gave most of his speeches while drunk.
obama class? obama diplomatic? obama is a narcissist nut job of left wing my way or the high way bs, having never worked with congress on anything

Come back and tell us all about it Dougie after the Germany people have voted next fall....We wait with bated breath.

You lost me at I've voted Liberal all my life....or I've voted Conservative all my life etc.....that line of thinking requires no thinking.
This is another one of those 'just say whatever' columns.

'What his cabinet show tells us about Trudeau?s vision'----------He's blind.
Amid all the celebration, it would be good to remember Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse at the hospital Kate was treated for morning sickness who committed suicide after a prank radio call. A life wasted because of the media hoopla.

El Cid seems unaware there was a religious component to the IRA fight. How bizarre.
The deficit spending only materialized recently as a desperate means of differentiating themselves from the NDP. It's really quite strange.
Someone had to stand up to Harper for his divisive and obnoxious comments. Trudeau has done it and done it well! For your editorial to imply that both men are saying the same thing is unfair and shows your biased and shallow thinking.
I guess freedom of thought isn't high in your values.
more drivel from Howard.
Yes, Conservatives are evil and Liberals and NDP are good. Yet another anti-Conservative hit piece in the Globe and Mail.

'Canada?s perpetual climate charade' Goes well with 'The perpetual Global Warming Charade.'
What is wrong with populations shrinking? Countries with population problems can't have free reign to just emigrate wherever they want. Growth in GDP isn't as important as sustainability and quality of life.
Yeah, in my province there is a $10,000 tax credit that you can claim in your first 10 years... I don't know anyone who's actually qualified to receive it.. your income has to be high enough that you don't need the credit to get the credit.

You don't hear about Bahrain because there is a major US naval base there, and the US government needs the current dictators to remain in power, so the US can continue to threaten sovereign nations with their military might in the region.
Canadians cannot realistically expect that any judge who is appointed by a police state will actually recommend a pilot program that would see what policing would be like with fewer weapons...
Probably not, unfortunately.
I am surprised 'sirencall' is posting here, as it doesn't involve Putin/Ukraine or Russia, and you can't run up a bill for it...unless of course someone domestic is picking up the tab for this one.
The Charter?
@ nolz teachers are tax payers too.
It's his jobbette.
To speak the truth can be so immature and childish to those who refuse to think! To add some truth, you could have mentioned that Harpo's presence in the building is shameful enough!
They would have reaped greater reward by reading Emily Bronte?s Wuthering Heights.
Wonderful - and as I always tell my friends, my idea of hell is to live ONLY with people my age (72)......how not to go brain dead - talk with any one younger and older people who are young in spirit.
Get a grip. After 3 more years of the drama teacher you'll be desperate for an adult to be in charge again.
Although We don't always agree, I think I could have an adult conversation with you.
The public will hopefully remember this and the growing list of incompetence, scandal, graft and social engineering lunacy in the next election and kick Orville Redenbacher's twin along with her bobbleheaded crew into Lake Ontario.
It has been widely and accurately observed that he is his own worst enemy. So in that sense, you're right that other mayors haven't had enemies as nasty as he does.
There should be no bowing to Arab interests until they disavow violence against Israel. Is that principle enough for ya!
Stephen Harper ? the longest consecutive streak of deficits of any government in Canadian history !! That is not true. http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/canada-deficit/index.html What is your source? Your rear end?
It's their bloody minded Congress and the about to be raptured wahoo element that scare the hell out of me, AC.
No, the people to blame are the politicians and citizens of the cities that have ignored their problems in the past.
Roma in Hungary, Slovakia and even in Czech Republic are still viciously persecuted in spite of these countries being labeled as democratic and/or safe.....
Yes. 'The woman who brought down Bill Cosby' itself is jumping the gun. Let's save 'brought down' for convictions.
Harper will torpedo your pension first chance he gets, just like he is doing with the vets. He's also making the age for retirement 67 instead of 65.
Good comment and good recovery. Thanks for the idea.
You're lying. The chart shows $199 in Toronto, $161 in Edmonton, $113 in Winnipeg, and $100 in Montreal.
Are there that many people in wheelchairs that need ramps? Are there that many blind people that need braille ?
Otherwise as promised, Canadians did not get an 'open' nor an 'accountable' Conservative government in 2006. But they did eventually did get a 'transparent' one as more and more Canadians can see right through it.
"What's your skin in the game?" I don't want measles.
Rifleman - it's the new Discovery Math at work - creating sheeple tax payers who don't yet understand orders of magnitude !
Good point. And how many of these individuals think being born in Canada is a personal achievement?
In other words, the fix was in
Yes, it is a complex term, hard to understand. I have come to detest the term "fully indexed defined benefit taxpayer subsidized public service pension". But not for the same reason
Israel is a state that continues to refuse recognition of its neighbours borders. In doing so it violates every UN resolution on the Israel/Palestine question since the start of the issue. What principle is Baird standing for?
And the price would be what exactly?
I'm wondering how this ever can be changed since the only ones who can change it are MPs who themselves are subject to an oath. Any attempt to change the citizen oath could be viewed as violating their own oath.
The hash tag justice crew are the same folks who several centuries ago would be the ones on the sidelines baying 'she's a witch! Burn her!'
Give me a vote, if yours is like mine! A job hasn't landed in his lap, and two years out from University fewer than a handful of actual job applications submitted. That's why my graduate can't get hired.
Hyperbole on your part doesn't help this discussion.
Don't you people understand? It is none of your business. He's vulnerable right now. Leave him alone. He will get back to you as soon as he's mended.......
The underlying problem is the ambivalent conservation mandate of US wildlife 'refuges.' They are not national parks, but open to commercial use by licensed hunters and farmers, under the jurisdiction of the US Bureau of Land Management.
Fear, fear, fear... have you no arguments on substance?
Don't forget the Globe and Mail, Prog.
Not the progressives.
It seems taking a moral stance is Un-Canadian. Better to stand for nothing.
We voted for Wynne in Ontario so I see us making the same mistake federally with Justin. Its too bad most people don't actually look at results. Must be too many people with Liberal Arts degrees.
A gem of a cult movie ....
Hopefully, it shuns the Reform party agenda and becomes a more reputable organization. May the party reform without the Reform.
Please provide a link. I've seen nothing like this in the NP.You can do it if you don't include the ht tp or www--
So the frequent death of innocents is the price we pay for criminals to roam free in our land. Got it. But you support a ban on firearms, right? For "personal safety". Of course - leftist hypocrisy at its finest.
Russia is guilty and Putin is a war criminal and you shill for that KGB thug. Must be hard for you to look in a mirror.
As long as your face is showing I don't think many people would have a problem with that. However, your employer may.
Geizella, you are so correct. Don't listen to Galbraith as he must be a bit like May. Telling a joke that is not understood. Rae made the provincial debt smaller???
I've seen worse in National Geographic.
Obviously not as smart as he thinks. Overcharging expenses is a real rookie mistake.
need to change the Canada health act before we start charging user fees. It's unconstitutional currently.
Absolutely!
The Conservatives would be wise to say nothing , saw wood and continue giving Mr. Trudeau more rope.
From what I've read of the comments, this article is so dis-credited that the G & M ought to pull it.
The Muslim people I have encountered couldn't be more helpful and kind to me. Complete strangers I have been humbled by their thoughtfulnessI don't think we should be painting all Muslims with the same brush
Don't see much difference between Trump and Drake. Is the latter bad for Toronto politics? Yes.
Unless their daddy's name was Pierre Trudeau, that is!
He is a Fraudafarian of the Oligarchy of Canada.
Well, Pierre Trudeau inherited a country that had the 2nd highest GNP per capita in the world (tied with Sweden) and ran it down to 14th or so. So there's competition.
'Pinko', vancharger? Really?! What are you, Archie Bunker?
Right on.!
Ok Mel, what Green Energy facility would you put in Attawapiskat, and who would maintain it?
Excellent article from a CERES fellow.
And Trump doesn't lie? steal? cheat?
Buy the who is going to pay for public goods like: Education, medical care, infrastructure, defence, diplomatic missions etc? Also we have to pay down the debt created by Harper and Mulroney.
Not really, Mosha (Moscow?) - and I really don't hate Russians. They should just remain in Russia if they don't want to be loyal citizens of Ukraine.
people have babies because we are animals like all others on the planet and we have strong desires to procreate. it's locked into us. otherwise we would have been extinct long ago. Too bad for the planet that we cannot get rid of 'that gene'.
Dieter... We were up in the Bancroft area this summer and Kathleen Wynne was on the radio blaming Mike Harris for the high energy prices in Ontario!
...And cry at the amount of debt that will be inflicted on Canadians.
so would I - but if I said that, my comment would have been deleted
MrBigg1, your memory is either very short or very ideologically selective. 40 years of Alberta (C)onservative rule, with ab$olutely nothing to show for it, already ran your province into the ground.
Hey Butron, Remember Stephen Harper... same hair...?
To all single young men out there... DO NOT GET MARRIED.... it is a suckers game! You are the sucker, and the women win. The End.
Your taxes wouldn't go up. The program would pay for itself.
AN EXCELLENT, WELL RESEARCHED ARTICLE that doesn't get into Israel's, 'poor me surrounded' Here are SHARED SIDES AND INFO WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT. THANX.
Thanks Tiu. That was a worthwhile read.
So back to that smarmy McLean. Now we get more of his sucking up to Cherry. What a farce.
Oh, you smug Canadians....Just wait until YOU get attacked....think it won't happen? Guess again. Then we'll see how 'tolerant' you are.
You're a lost cause man . I won't even bother to try and explain to you why what you're saying is so insane .
The can always download the 'lulu' app and compare boyfriends. Oddly another story today.
Venezuela should be a lesson to all Ontarians that we can't spend and borrow ourselves rich.
That's exactly what they've done. Beck, Toronto's most popular taxi company, offers an app. All their taxis are licensed taxis with taxi plates affixed.
Here, here! (or, 'hear, hear').
Indeed. Normally Marcus Gee can be counted on for a reasonable article. Is this an audition piece for The Sun?
She was quoting from an old magazine......
Wall should just be glad he gets to keep all the revenue and decide what to do with itAll he has to do is cut other taxes to make it revenue neutral and this is doneQuestion is - how many days until Wall finally agrees to do this?
Move to salaries and pensions and the office overhead doesn't go away. Someone still has to pay it. Unless the government wants to literally buy the office and equipment, assume all expenses, and pay all the staff, the salary model can't work.
We also have anti-environmentalists
The new conservative Sun G&M now has a new mandate, bash Liberals going forward until they get their conservatives in.
And who might that be? The woman who wrote this piece, the one who dispensed with the Isreali leader's speech in less than four line in order to get back to the issues at hand, namely, the 'gaping holes' in Obama's plan?
are you saying the people of brandon are insignificant? wow. that's harsh.
If your sentence about Mulcair is true and voters get wind of it, the NDP will be destroyed.
Fool! You should be making a list of friends and families for your own group of overpaid oafs and loafs.
John, just pack it in before you have a real hairy conniption
I wish I were in Rob Ford's party. He has leadership quality. Determination, clarity of vision, and the personality to dwarf his opponents. Good Luck (future) Prime Minister Ford.
I guess this would also be a justification for female genital mutilation and any other number of abhorrent and repulsive cultural practices which over time have been 'linked' to religion.
It's about money, it always is.
Or paid Con hacks more like.
There are approximately 1.6 billion Muslims in the world. If they all thought like ISIS, we would have been eradicated years ago.
why is it , no matter what the subject of the article ..99% of female writers think they have to include some sort of BS about violence to women.
Contrast with National Post - yes, National Post headline 20:00 EDT: 'Stephen Harper?s adviser, Ray Novak, knew of Wright?s plan to pay $90,000 to Duffy, statement claims'
That you Doug the dealer?
Yes, yes, yes... And the Donald's vision ends with champagne socialism. Or at least with champagne.
The value of a life is not priceless. If it was we would ban all automobiles, tobacco and alcohol, fire, contact sports etc etc.
They are people just like us. To call them a cancer on the world only shows your own bias.
With Trump in the mix, the debates were sure to be ugly even before this. Inflame ? They are already are. Only the Republican party can save America by denouncing their racist leader!
who are these people that write these columns? They represent no one. This is not the opinion of the majority of Canadians.
Lay off the Oxy, Von....
What? You want to ban religion in people's personal lives?!?!?!
Gibson's modus operandi is to post outrageous comments and run away. He very, very seldom backs them up. I think there's a word for that.

The Feds have not done so well either... F-35 Lightning... G20 fiasco... GazebosWe can do this all day... it won't get transit built
What you consider 'reasonable' is discriminatory and illegal.
As I recall the Liberals said they knew what the would do with the right to die legislation. If so why did they wait so long to introduce a bill that the Alberta court ruled that it did not meet the riling bu the SCC?
"ha ha"? You might want to pick someone other than Nelson Muntz as your role model.
Hudak is not responsible for the current financial mess in Ontario. Still journalists are after Hudak rather than the premier. They must be the pet-bull of the governing party.
You will have a pristine environemnt without the developemnt, but our capacity to enjoy that pristine environment will be limited, as we will have all frozen to death.
'Or, worse, these pictures will become propaganda as each ?side? ? as if chaos has sides ? seeks to buttress the righteousness of their positions.'Nice job of demonstrating the point Ms. Renzetti was making there, Poog.
'We either pay for pensions now or future generations will pay in taxes later. 'That is a standout argument in The Third Rail, aowguy. Spot on.
Hmm ---its like getting married and still having a mother in law as the head ofyour household. Suppose it can work--- is everyone in the household happy?
Last week, a review of Cuchillo that swerved between personal vendetta and bad day. This week, a review about being snubbed by the bartender and not being recognized. Can we request a restaurant critic who brings a little less baggage to the meal?
He's lied regarding deficits spending and a return to balance, he simple hoping he can maintain the public trust before inflicting more damage!
I almost want to write that article but I don't know enough. How about you?
Seems to me that this thing could be resolved by the U.S. getting on the same page as every other country in the world (excdept Eritrea) and taxing U.S. citizens based on residency rather than citizenship.
Mr. Brown's 'earlier use of sex-ed as a political wedge issue is now being used against him.'As his supporters could tell him, as ye sow, so shall ye reap.
Dear Globe & Mail: Get bent. Sincerly, the people of Alberta.
@Monkey121 ? and, while we're at it. Capitalism does not "create" wealth ? it is a system for extracting surplus value. Not the same thing.
The point is that it is totalitarian - duh - that is the problem.
I agree, but it is important that the police also change where it is needed. It seems to be clear that some change is warranted. Police change is a small part of the solution, but it is part of the solution nonetheless.
ti-pite don't generalize most European countries had no colonization do you have white guilt for all Europeans?
Are you saying there is a monetary agreement between Nestle and the BC Liberal party?
Good point Glenn.
So would most of the Les Quebecois, and I'm not talking about Europe.
Why would you make a case for rubbing shoe polish on your face? I am proud to be a citizen of a country which welcomes people from everywhere and I can respect their traditions such as they are.
Brown, a pitiful case in point.
Right. Hahahhahahahaaa!
Trudeau Justin II experienced???
Amen. Sarcasm attempted. I also cannot believe that we are allowing this religious abuse to be legal.
That must be a state supplied dictionary!
Mr. Martin fails to point out that it is the role of the Opposition to hold the Government to account.
Lorrie Goldstein and Christie Blatchford have both taken Ford to task over his creative math. Gee is a little late the the party. Both Goldstein and Blatchford have denounced this nose-stretching BS that both idiot brothers spew.
Indeed - he has repeatedly shown that when it comes to our money, there is no price too high to keep him in it.
That's her selling point, the reason she is published. She gets the dander up.
The CBC pointed out last night that the Conservatives had done the same things to an even larger degree.
Lack of comprehensive sex education.
the reason it is popular1. because it is the RIGHT thing to do Right as in correct Right as in not leftist2. because Harper is popular so his anti terror bill is popular
I was surprised to find your comment. A couple of mine pointing out the poor writing and grammar (which the G&M outsources to posters) have been deleted. I guess the lawyers agot upset at something.
Yes! A very important distinction. They are also forgetting his promise to clean things up and do politics differently. Their leader has lied to them, broken his promises to them, and they still come back for more. Why?
Really- so cut em loose and let's just go with every man for himself then. Brilliant.
Most modern historians discount the link to Saturnalia. For an alternate view, consider the following discussion: http://www.historytoday.com/matt-salusbury/did-romans-invent-christmas
Mr. Lawerence worships Trudeau. rather telling he wrote such an article.
Ms Wente Please explain your definition of ' An Elite '. Thankyou.
Actually, Doug8, EGetsOne is right: she's not being hyper hysterical at all. She is being very silly and wrong-headed, though. There is a difference.
Perhaps you are one of the exceptions that proves the rule.
The NDP have the same problem. I wouldnt call allowing some votes to be recast over and over again particularly fair. It favours the Liberals which is why they are advocating for it.
Monarchy belongs to Medieval times and has no place in 21st century. Now every man is a King and every woman is a queen.
Mr.Simpson you are wrong about tax policy and justice there will in the longer haul be a trend of reversal for the better. Not all of the people have such shortsighted views of society as the Conservatives have
Thanks for the post, cachet-
Chauncey Gardiner. Please look him up. The resemblance is amazing.
Wow!!! What a bunch of self-important, Starbucks drinking, downtown elites posting here. Please get over yourselves. I
Okay can someone explain to me the point of this useless piece other than a filler for an add.
Let's talk the morning after the election. You can't see past your partisan blinkers and are going to wake up to huge surprise. Watch and see
Rather snooty. Sure, there are mindless idiots on this site but pomposity is just as bad. If someone has a differing view than you, don't bellow 'troll' or ' denier'. It just makes you one of 'them'. Cheers.
Maybe not a crime - for these jerseys to qualify as a crime they'd have to be improved a lot.

Mulroney was another in a long-line of Quebec bagmen. Whether is was with the Iron Ore Company, Airbus, Bombardier or a myriad of other things - what mattered was how he could personally profit.

The ONLY G7 country in a recession in 2015... Canada In related (right-wing) news: good is bad, bad is good and pigs fly.
In my culture, it is improper to cover one's face in public. Criminals and thieves do that. The good people of the town show who they are. I find it disturbing when I see a full face covering on someone.
actually Ontario and Quebec have an Agreement for hydro power sharing... Offsetting peak power draws.. sorta back-me -up
Canada must do all it can do to alleviate the suffering. More bombs is not the solution.

Better than no democracy at all.
It reminds me of Sir Francis Drake, who circumcised the world with a hundred-foot clipper.
Pederasty was the most common kind of homosexual love practiced back in the time of Deuteronomy, which might explain why some people objected to it. Older man, younger teenage boy, imbalance of power.

I'm curious about Margerat's education and when she got it. But then, that was the 70's (?), when all things were possible. How would she fair today with those qualifications?
Due to our first past the post electoral system, a party can win a parliamentary without getting a majority of the votes.
It is still a scam, everyone who has done some homework knows that.
Ms. Wente's opinons and actions are often considered at minimum incorrect.
Soldiers on the streets???
that's wonderful - So you get to insult and harass people if you are a millionaire? Good to know.
Sure play the race car. It is not a racist policy because it applies to members of every race who are not citizens nor permanent residents of Canada. what is so racist about it?
TRL:'You truly do read what you want to hear.'Do we not all?
No surprise coming from Simpson.
That won't help. This is what Harper didn't understand. Yelling at people doesn't make them buy your oil. They just won't buy it.
A sign of perimeter defense failing... moving to position #2...I am sure she has several more fall back arguments... ending with 'HE IS CRAZY FOLKS'...
Agreed. But the article never states that, and I suspect that the author has no clue.
'Information and its communication lie at the heart of democracy.'The Harper government lies at the heart of democracy.
Then Trump and his backers must be pre-prehistoric. Take a bow.
I think Peggy was discussing supplements. I've not yet heard of a supplement that youtake to increase your trans fat levels. If thereis, I'm not having any.
This was happening in the sixties and seventies. That is not a century ago. Hitler used the United States and Canadian residential school system as part of his model for the concentration camps.
I created an account just to let you know how idiotic this article sounds. For an article on the bitcoin crash it rarelt mentioned bitcoins. Just ramblings about nonsense.
As are their collegues now.
The only shame here is Trudeau. To buy his 'helping him' BS requires suspension of intelligence.
Some EXCELLENT, common sense points! Good for you!

Engage Canada is funded by the Unions to influence the electorate. Who are being funded by the Liberal and NDP backroom boys.
Mulcair is a federalist, was involved in provincial politics with the Liberals. His stance on sovereignty is: 50% +1, like in any democracy. Separatism in QC is in a really bad shape and will never again retrieve its past strength.
"The Work Farce" is looking for Root Cause Trudeau Jr would approve
Agree. This is not about helping humanity

If memory serves you are a lawyer working for unions. As such it suggests that your views are hardly impartial.
The length of the transmission line matters, not whether it is submarine or not. Look at the size of European countries vs Canada. European utilities only have to transmit power over short distances to get across entire countries.

Well, they won't have to leave quite as much 'in the ground' when the balloons go up on a world mission to save what's left of a livable biosphere.
A slang word blacks use to refer to police is racist if uttered by anyone except a black person and for their exclusive use? Seriously?

The number of government employees has increased and they're contracting out the work they used to do. Why aren't the employees doing the work anymore?
Answer is easy- until they get divorced. Then they want to be looked after for the rest of their lives.
In Vancouver the Broadway line is packed solid with riders, as are lines in downtown Toronto. They pay their way and then some. Empty buses in the country lose money.
How much? What odds? How to ensure that the loser pays up?

When I read leftie, commie or Marxist I just stop reading. It is a sign of drivel to follow.
Oh yeah, and a heads-up to RevCan that money will be changing hands here; make sure the income is declared!
Don't you and Harper wish the judges he appointed were more amenable to your message ?
Largest deficit Largest Mass Arrest of Citizens in Canadian history.============================Hilarious coming from a McGuinty cheerleader...
For a long time I thought that he should be called little fingers, now I think the best synonym for Stephen Harper is FU. Says it all.
How can you be so sure that God, if there is one, is talking to you in your own words, and not to me, who disagrees with you utterly? And if he is talking to you, then do you have the right to impose your view on others?
Well you can count me out on the monarchy support thing... I have respect for Queen Elizabeth but don't feel she holds any power over me because she came out of a different womb.
'...will announce the new government's course of action when it's is ready.'I fear the worst, because of the tight-rope walking that he and the PM need to continue to do to placate 'allies'.
It's certainly isn't her cough that makes her unfit to lead. It's her lying and the 'I'm above the law' attitude that makes her unfit to lead.
In other words, Harper and his PMO boys in short pants have their fingers crossed for a massacre.
Steven, I wouldn't call the average Canada a "hater". Maybe a self-centered, aggressive, arrogant pain the butt.
But rest assured our saviour, who is measuring eyes for eyes, and teeth for teeth, will be placated.
Fred Garvin MP ------ Should read the news more. Finding some dummy smoking dope behind the wheel is as easy as 123.
Wow! Who would have thought they'd increase their percentage vote after Flaherty died as is not running. Stop the presses! LOL!
Both Harper and Trudeau know that selling him as a teacher will benefit the Liberals at the expense of the NDP. Win-Win in some circles. However you can not become PM solely based on the union vote in Canada.
Well said, Slippery Slope. This newspaper has EXACTLY the kind of ethics of the government it supports and the columnists it chooses to promote and defend -- a NAMBLA promoter and a recidivist plagiarist. 'Disgrace' is precisely the right term.
I am sure a blind horse would feel that way.
Yes off with their heads, only football hooligans are kind and generous people.
*yawn*I'm sorry, was JB ranting? Did I miss anything?
Are you really this stupid?
Perhaps by "success" he means that Fox News enjoys the largest viewership of all news stations in the U.S. All that hate pulls in viewers down there, making Fox very influential.
You didn't answer my question. If Wente needs a science course why doesn't Trudeau? The real reason is that anyone who agrees with you must be right.
I don't think you have enough to do during your average day.
haahhaha good one!!

Sure, lets make prison into luxury hotels, provide breakfast, lunch and supper in bed and give daily massages. People a prison is just that, a PRISON and if you don't like to end up there, don't break the law.
It is you who are among the fabled 'ill informed' and you are so willingly which is even more disturbing. To guys like you, all 'facts' are those that conform to your own mythology and everything else is deemed someone's agenda.

"It isn't illegal for an 18 year old to have sex with a seventeen year old" LOL. Good luck convincing a judge of that. In California, where the offense in question took place, the legal age of consent is 18.
If you have the answers on how to run a country correctly how come you aren't. Did you even run for office.
The Ndp may not be the perfect answer, but they are the best answer for today
Are the free clinics numerous enough and large enough to meet even a significant fraction of the need?
Sorry to disappoint you DB, but I self-identify as an anglophone.
Its a culture of entitlement and there are 3.5 million on the government payrolls Thats why we are upset because it all flows from the top down.....Globe.
One can only go by the record, Miakue. They're called SOCIAL conservatives for that reason.
I am NOT in favour of Trudough's plan.
Trump did not target immigrants but 11 million ILLEGAL Mexican immigrants that is targeting invaders not immigrantsJustin should learn a lesson from this
What chemical, deoxyribonucleic acid? What are you going to scream about next, dihydrogen monoxide?
Because Doug loves the microphone and is always ready with a bon mot. Also Rob doesn't like to talk to the press so they go to Doug who thinks he's Mayor too.
Are there any Moslem women reading this ?
Furthermore this has NOTHING to do with hiding taxable income from the U.S. This is absurd. Where are you getting your information?
This is the problem. Nobody is going to invest there. It's dangerous for the police or othercity workers to even go in there. You cannot force immigrants to liveanywhere. If an immigrant's job in their homecountry was 'war lord', they might go.
Rapture: You just lost whatever little credibility you had.
Thats why the mainstream german population refer to the 1 million influx as 'Tourists' so that athey are not branded as racist for expressing an opinion.
If he does, it will be a lie, so why bother?
Its definitely not in Obamas game plan with Executive orders
I'd rather rub it in his face.
'.........U.S. politicians had been busy spreading hysteria .....'Sounds like Konrad is attempting to spread his own brand of 'hysteria'.
i too am surprised as to why 'the old south' has not been talked about more
Jocabe...... it is about having a qualified leader for the opposition. He is dangerous having no resume for the job. Garneau was so accomplished and probably brilliant and the Liberals rejected him over pretty boy Justin with the name.
I suspected that this government would provide endless entertainment. I am not disappointed. Hopefully the next generation can pay the bill for this circus.
Since the population of the GTA is about 5 million, over a third of the province reside in that one area.
'in the UK the parliamentary party has a direct say in the leadership selection and removal process' ......... Would they ever have the nerve to try that with the majestic one? To even suggest a new 'family' to reign would be considered treason!
But I recall Trudeau campaigning against the child care benefits especially for rich people like himself. No one is begrudging having two nannies....but many are due the fact that the taxpayer is paying for them.
Perhaps I remember wrongly, but I thought the Globe endorsed Sliverman.
Getting your hammer and sickle flag ready for tomorrow?
Mom you are a hero and I applaud you. I also wish all the best for your son and we are so blessed having people like you in this world. Definite prayer for you and your son at church this Sunday!

Less abusive? You mean because she interested in you anymore?
Vote, donate, and keep on talking. Citizens like you have made Canada and the US better countries.
Justin says Canada has no 'core identity'so instead of promoting 'diversity'maybe Justin should promote 'core identity'
'However, the climate has not warmed in the last 16 years.'Wrong. You haven't read AR5 yet, have you?
some people's lack of historical knowledge is farcical. Thye could have been typing on 17 September 1939 when the Soviet government announced it was acting to protect the Ukrainians and Belarusians who lived in the eastern part of Poland
And dare I mention: is Israel open to those inspections ?
What do qualification have to do with it...look what canada got stuck with in the last election. All you need is a name
Coach, agreed that doctors are private contractors but that does not give them the right to impose their own religious beliefs on patients.
If anything, he's shaking things up and under the current climate of tyrannical political correctness maybe it's time for a shake up.
Of what ? :)
Bankers are not paid using tax money, the banks can pay them whatever they want, it is none of our business.
Quebec brewers did not add extra costs. They actually have to compete in Quebec and offer lower costs to consumers. Why do you think so many folks in Ottawa buy their beer in Quebec?
The Moroccan born mayor of Rotterdam suggested bluntly that those who don't like western values should leave. He used more direct language on TV. The rest is censored.
Dalton Camp was a 'Progressive' Conservative and that is much different than the Conservatives that are in power now. Many Progressive Conservatives have denounced the the Harper policies including two ex-PC Prime Ministers.
Tim: Get real it's not their hearts they are thinking with!
Yes, by all means, Canada should not support Israel the only democracy in the Middle East, but should be supporting the women-, homosexual- and non-Muslim- hating Muslim countries.
Don't think pensions have to start paying out at 71. Got anything to show your factually correct?
Are you a paid employee of the LPC or just blinded by the Sunny Ways?
Typical juvenile response. Make uber drivers stop charging money that nets them any profit and see how many "sharers" there are.
Couldst be your petroleum purchases are funding the rebels.
We have absolutely no idea how many people living in Canada share their beliefs.
Bean counters at the helm.
Excellent post, thanks
What's less harmful than already-not-harmful?
I bet if research were done in China, Russia, India, Germany results would be different.
Really? How was Denmark, Finland and Sweden involved?
Umm... Peter, I'm an evangelical and I am on here a lot yelling at climate change deniers. Care to look beyond your stereotypes?
Exactly, the muffin man did a great job 'floating' through ten years in office with accomplishing NOTHING on the pipeline issue on his watch! But the cons just pull the tin foil hats tighter and deny all responsibility for the lost decade!
Rationalization see how the leftists rationalize that the actor did the right thing because they AGREE with his ideology if they DISAGREED they would be singing a different tune this emeritus professor is a shame to all professors
@ack, sexism and race/minority is always an issue in occupations that are predominately white male and get paid a ton of money for doing mostly nothing.
...and evidence-based, no matter your political stripes.
yep - clearly based in the USA
KATO 50- "still do wield enormous power in (Iran) to the point that they can dictate who runs the government." You are talking about Mr. Harper aren't you ?? CAREFUL.
Give me a break. There is precisely zero comparison between actual slaves and metaphorical working 'slaves' of today. If you think otherwise, you need to refer to history books for some facts.
Texas recently allowed open carry of hand guns, they should wait and see how that works for them. If hand gun violence goes down, then so much the better for them. Just to be sure though, I'm going to avoid Texas.
As for Kandahar being the gay capital of South Asia, are you referring to the Dancing Boys, Bacha Bazi? Hardly a model either...
And that subsequently means that Harper and the CPC are likely going after the perennial non-voters instead in an effort to boost support, as the undecideds and swing voters won't be buying in this time.
Dennis Moore attempted to redistribute lupins with mixed results.
This is a legal issue, not physics. Legal issues are decided by advocates making arguments, citing precedence and anticipating so far as is possible, on what issues or legal principles the court will factor most heavily in making a decision.
To her it is, just read her piece about Ferguson...
Oh weeks and weeks - why didn't you say so??? Of course, spending entire weeks (and weeks!) to decide the system under which the entire country elects a government is just a waste of time.
Andrew - great comment - signed in just to vote you up
They need to rent a helicopter for their next protest and land on the PUBLIC lake while some guests are fishing. Take off, land again. Repeat.
But even more likely, he values his own escape from accountability re: his Senate scandal that he does the supposed importance of the Syrian situation.
How it's done is the issue, and man-oh-man, what weasels these guy are
Actually, the pattern is consistent - Under Mike Harris, our debt ballooned. He was too busy bribing voters with unsustainable tax cuts. Its the Neo-Con way; Thatcherism at its best. And over the last 35 years, it is a proven failure.
Convicted by who? Putins thugs?
Canada is an immigrant country, always has been and always will be - get used to it.
Y'know, Doug, a column is usually improved if you can show some semblance of recognizing the contours of what you are arguing against. Your globalizing biases seem to prevent you from being intelligible on this subject.
Milou is right. That is exactly what the GLBTQ are saying.
Thanks for a thoughtful and well written post that presents an oft not spoken perspective.
Trudeau's "over the top holocaust references" are figments of the Globe editors' imaginations. Harper's fear mongering is incontrovertible.
In my opinion, a nonsensical comment.
Cassandra: The only unmitigated disaster is the Liberal Party of Ontario. That's why the federal version should lose the upcoming election. Ontario might deserve the Liberals. Quebec and BC too. But the rest of the country deserves much much better.
Surprised that this piece made it to print in the G&M.
So you're all in favour of paying more taxes to keep petty thieves in jail longer. Maybe, the rest of us aren't. Mandatory minimums for certain crimes make sense. It doesn't make sense to keep some kid in jail for years because he stole a pizza!
We should also have a referendum on immigration in Canada. But why would they start caring what Canadians think....
One thing we can all do is clean out medicine cabinets of old prescriptions - this program takes old meds away rather than poisoning our water http://www.healthsteward.ca/
Actually, the Glass-Steagle Act was repealed by the Republican Congress, and signed into law by Clinton. Certainly he should have vetoed it. Overall it was a conspiracy against the people of the United States.
What are you talking about? Majority of the population in Crimea do not want to join Russia. And that is why Canadian Government supports Ukraine. Read some REAL analysis
Wonder what the typical voter turnout is in Toronto. In Vancouver it's about 30%, which is why we get Mayor Moonbeam and is band of Visionistas doing their best to destroy the city, with a mandate from 15% of the eligible voters...
It's the Pharmaceutical companies you should be watching over - duh!
The Arab petro-dollar lobby at work again.
I am willing to bet that the G&M will never give us the real story on Uber,
Hopefully along with a big gay dude named Bubba.
@JJ - but just think how bored you'd be without her to excoriate.
since WWll the trouble was international communism and not international fascism
so westernpat when harper did make the similar comments about the Saudi king you were on here posting the same outrage? Just answer that first.
Naive and for the most part, ignorant of the realities of the world outside of what CBC, CTV and Global news reports.
Succinct and perfectly put.
And worst of all, it is guaranteed to create many more peasants.
Harper is the third-best solution.
When nobody has money to spend on shiny new 4x4 trucks that never leave the city.
Anyone who supports Putin supports terrorism.
What is needed far more is a Triple E Senate to prevent single party domination. Pretty easy to see why the Dippers and Broadbent want PR...it's an attempt to gain power by backroom deals instead of by public consent.
No, I do not. But that is not really the point, either. This piece is about what the outside world thinks.
The NDP is going to win, so I hope you put your house on the market on May 15th. bye , bye for 4 years at least and perhaps longer.
I'm sorry, the term 'a Second Amendment solution' is clearly code for 'go out and shoot someone.' It's in the usage.
Go Bruins????? Living proof that the G&M is a Toronto newspaper and not a national one. How about Go Habs Go!!! There is another Canadian team in the playoffs. Just in case you hadn't noticed.
And it's been driving civilized society into the ground for the whole time!
It seems the media are reading what they want into Trump's words.
They are Hamas activists... spare us in the wrong place at the wrong time... they were advised it was a no go zone Newfie!
Are other non-Ontarioians starting to get bored with the HarpoCult's constant interruption of our national dialogue?
Boom! Excellent Mr Simpson, you nailed it.
Newsreader60... it's exactly that stigma that you profess which puts these women in danger in the first place. After all, they're only hookers, right?
How soon we forget Chamberlain tried to appease Hitler and look what happened. Thank God for Churchill or we would be all speaking German. ISIS needs to be destroyed and the only way is for the allies to unite including the Russians.
Well put, Richard.
Justin Trudeau won British Columbia the moment he said he was for pipelines, just NOT for the Northern Gateway Pipeline. Justin Trudeau listens to people, and responds; doesn't just tell them what they want to hear.
And you are better informed than the CIA. I think Obama should rely on you for intelligence briefings!
If we weren't so fixated on Iran and Riussia being "the bad guys" we could get together with them and negotiate a diplomatic solution. This bombing is doing no good other than making us feel useful/macho.
Hey now - Bieber had talent and toured his butt off for years to make his name! Justin just kinda fell into this gig cuz part time drama teaching wasn't paying his wife's clothing bills.
the daughter of a drape maker.....has been living off the public teet her entire adult life. Maybe she should try making drapes... or opening a small business....he lack of understanding about business, taxes, business regulations is astonishing.
Great article. The Russian regime is completely fascist and must be stopped.
The federal government still kicks in education money for special education and French language.
Toronto air is pretty clean when the winds are blowing from Canada. It becomes awful when the wind comes from the south where, among other things, there is a lot of coal-fired generation..
What effrontery by the Libs and Trudeau! As anyone knows, it's the Globe who gets to tell us who Canadians really are with their alleged omniscient perspective that transcends political partisanship. Barf.
Cute follow up question ;-)
Nobody wants to change the system. Only the losers propose a change to better their prospects.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH - CONS! The more you rap on this; the more you demonstrate how pathetic your reaction to defeat has become!
If the employers are unemployed, what happens to their employees?

The puppet master is at it again. Usually we see his hand up Rob's shirt moving his mouth, now he's running his own. These guys are like Abbott and Costello only dumber.
I think you mean equalization payments
Obama is catering to his followers. It has nothing to do with Harper.
If the East votes in a Trudeau '(again)' the West will be ripe for separating.
Seriously, why not? I can't imagine that anybody would be harmed by seeing a shirtless high school student, of either sex.
you can see intelligence, I would say your blind, right.
Impeach the double-dealing cretin and imbecilic PM 'Steve' Harper!
Are you dumb enough to believe that if Canada doesn't sell oil nobody else will?
I'm sure mulroney is pleased when you tell him what he meant to say.
They were already open to them.
I haven't always agreed with Simpson but I have always respected his opinion as one that came from a place of consideration. All the best, Jeffrey, in the next phase.
This is indeed the 'forced reduction of the deficit' as Mountebourg said. And he has already set in play stimulation so that debt is more than 50 per cent of GDP. What is there to criticize ?
Do Canadians actually accept this drivel from the Cons. They should feel insulted that the Cons think they do!
I think its time Jim stopped using the union trained and supplied hair dresser!
What is wrong with you people ?....The government has your best interests at hand and knows what is best for you .......now hand over that money !
How many six year olds have blown up planes?

Again, WHAT law??? Again, check your facts! http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/living-abroad/elections-faq
With proportional representation, how does the electorate 'fire' an incompetent MP who's been appointed a seat instead of actually winning one? No thanks.
I don't understand your logic. With the preferential ballot, how would the government 'not reflect the way the country as a whole voted?'
Sorry to disappoint Dieter and mbd: I do not have an english degree, nor am I a 'he'. I do have a BA in political science and psychology, as well as LLB (law). I spelled comrade wrong: through inadvertance, or recent bout with blindness. My bad.
By the measure of your posts you are not in a position to judge. Nor would I think the editorial board want support from you.
The provinces regulate liquor and it is no great hardship to get a drink in another province. I see no reason why provincial cannabis regulation would be any different.
I think a referendum on the matter is in order..... (after which we throw the warmongers with their jingoism and brinkmanship out -maybe stick them on a deserted island somewhere to duke it out)
You should change your nom d'internet to 'Patton'. It's not a compliment: he too thought anyone suffering from shell shock was malingering.
Lori lives in an ivory tower and hasn't stepped out into the real world yet.
Hooey. That's just another way for part of the dirty party to avoid responsibility for their filthy capitulation to the HarpoCult. Tory is as tory does.
Jenni coined the phrase 'The Base plus eight'..... that was as far as her thinking got.
Trapeze: Explain where I'm wrong. You Liberals keep ignoring this vital point in order to frighten other Candians that
Thumper, you are so lucky to be that much more clever than 'a lot of other people.'
Huh? Since when is using a contraction of ?technology is? bad grammar?
Not to mention taking JT's comments completely out of context. The words about Que. were what his father had said... not JT.The ad is just plain dis-honest.
May I suggest the UK's Labour Party's One Nation and you can hum the Red Flag as you read it.
And the term "orgy" is synonymous with the Romans.
LOL.... perfect picture!!
Where do you live, Mission?
I have to agree. The claim to save the waterfront should have started 40-50 years ago. Condos and industrial use has long since removed the waterfront from any enjoyment by the public.
Wrong. People will not pay for it. No collective cohesion. They talk about change and doing the right thing, but as usual they will not pay for it. Socially liberal and progressive, fiscally conservative. That is WASP Toronto.
We an get money just for loving to look at other people's babies?
What she did was fight back. Funny how you bullies and cowards can never handle that.
ToZ: I see you are an illiterate.
'Loose the funny clothes'? How about other cultures/religions? Do they need to lose their 'funny' clothes? Personally, I am offended by young men wearing pants that are falling down. Where do we start?
you complain about hds but then use terms like 'great justini' ????? Not much insight there.
No Respect for taxpayers, they want more taxes because of their incompetent management. Liberals looking to blow the middle class out of the water some more.
You idea of the NDP is just what the corporate media have given you.....nothing at all since the election. Noticed the fairness and balance of the fundamental institutions in this jaded "democracy"?
'In one evening, we lost the freedom to work in 27 wonderful European countries.'Are you not free to become a citizen of Italy, or is there some reason it won't have you?
Albertans need to wake up and find alternative to their one trick pony called the Tar sands.

WOW and you can ingest 10mg a day from drinking water Good on ya mate Mind Green probably could, be cause he has a conflict of interest here He wants to scaremonger about fluoride because he makes bottled water Funny that
Actually as English is your second language you're probably better equipped in understanding it than native speakers. At least that's been my observation.
You should be careful with 'no gun fights for turf' statements, because this year saw a pretty considerable increase in gun fights, most likely - for turf.
'the demise of Canada's international reputation.' Canada is number 1 in the world for reputation Under Stephen Harpers Conservative Government.
Spot on, Alex.
In some ways - yes. But he did lead the boycott of South Africa, and he deserves credit for the Meech Lake attempt.
Ethics? See: Senator John (the Liberals did it) Ibbitson and Margaret (copy cat) Wente.
the other religions take their stats in other countries. There is more to the world than our little corner ....I'm betting you live in Toronto , correct ?
Why can't they become Canadian citizens?
You don't actually comprehend what you read, do you?
Not to mention any country involved in anyway in developing and carrying out the regime change doctrine, the development of rebel militias or or the provision of weapons and other arms to the middle east.
Tim is our hero... and making how much? And even if he fails miserably without getting elected he makes how much? On tax dollars... just by talking out his as*...
Only in your twisted dreams has Harper stood up to Putin - whenever Putin's name is mentioned, Harper instantly soils himself while dashing into the nearest closet to cower.
That's because you hate Toronto.
OK, so the government should do exactly what is promised during the election campaign, no more and no less? The world is not static. The minds of our leadership should not be, either.
Interesting, although generally we have found (in Ontario) that it is the right wing wing-nuts who espouse such drivel. Just shows that there are strange people on either side of the spectrum.
All my assertions can easily be checked with a search engine and Grade 3 arithmetic. Can I refer you to a local early childhood education centre so you can acquired these

With half a minute of thought, anything less than many many thousand dollars worth of purchases is indistinguishable. Basically, as long as you aren't buying a brand new big screen which falls under my "smart enough" caveat.

My God. Do you think ISIS operates without support from within the Muslim world? Including from within the Muslim diaspora in Canada?
At least you admit it.

Wonderful lady - imbecilic policies repeated for 11 years to buy votes - far from wonderful....
There is no such thing as a marathon record time, because terrain is not standardized and changes with time.
Keith, where did you get your information from ? Please give us your references or a serious link. A nd i am not talking about some biaised G&M aticle.
With Justin bringing in 25,000 new votes by Christmas, the Canada that we once knew is gone forever. I will never see another conservative government in my lifetime and I fear for my children and grandchildren under this perverse liberal agenda.
Don't be so gullible. Most of the incidents are fabricated so people such as yourself readily give up their rights and freedoms.
He was Governor of Florida - they apparently thought he was pretty smart :-)
To allow one person to wear a headcovering because of their religion, and to disallow others to wear a headcovering, is religious discrimination.
Idiot alert
Two? From where I stand, only the Liberals have a voice of any kind.
Great article.
There is nothing laudable that I can see that we would want to adopt from Arab/Muslim culture and I know I am not the only one.
Ron, are you good with the PMO, Senators and CPC officials in their own words interefering into an independent financial audit?
Which 'radical islamists' are in his cabinet?
How about building explosive devices to be deployed againstbCanadian and other allied soldiers? There's a word for that, rhymes with 'season'.Or perhaps was he knitting sweaters or building toys for them?
How come +2-7 = 0? For a comment total in a post which favours the Globe in this debate. Or +34-12 = 12, in a post which is critical of the Globe's official line. The darkest pages of the history book of the moral devolution of free Canadian press.
Enemies everywhere: The flip side of power-hunger is paranoia.
The PMO has fumbled very badly on this issue (whether Steve was personally involved or not) and Senator Duffy should resign forthwith. Very disappointing performance.
She used the musket while being attacked by the Iroquois. Second choice?
Yeah, just take 'em out behind the barn.

Barry Goldwater also advocated a Guaranteed Annual Income.......

Where is the outrage from Danish tourist to this story?
Do you need less roads as well? Try again indeed!
Europeans discovered, and made available to all, electricity and pretty much everything you use in your daily modern life. The rest of the world, not so much.
Wow!, kind of out of touch BC. The 1950-60s and 2015 are from two different planets economically. You showed your real colours with this remark. I am now even more sure that you are a partisan fraud.
you are asking a liberal to think. not going to happen
Golly. No ads encouraging them to vote. How low can we go?
Actually, that isn't true. I pay taxes as a nonresident (currently 0). The tax system in most countries (I can't say 'all' because I have lived in only seven) is based on residence. I think the USA and Eritrea are the only exceptions.
This column and $1.45 will get you a coffee at Tim's.

The slimming industries make billions trying to slim us. The mainstream food industries make humungo-quadrillions trying to fatten us up. We gorge, surf, and treadmill. Sic transit gloria mundi.
The day we stop committing them.
So you propose we sit on it and then....
Audits do not work it has to be more strict . Audits will approve things like Misc. or gifts or travel not say why so much travel with so many people or why is this poor reserve spending 200 thousand dollars on gifts each year.
The 'Nanny State 'generation is flying now, blame parents and politicians for this.
Whatever ....
..very true Robert 320
Uh huh - have you forgotten Carolina?
At least it proves that there are liberal Muslims and that Muslims are equal target of terrorism from extremists.
Accusations ?Try to Be_A_Real_Human... because you ain't much of a journalist either.
Yes, the government policies are such, that success must be punished hard and therefore discouraged. The US will welcome them with open arms.
...........................How shallow of you. But thanks anyway for your constructive POV.
Touched a nerve did I? Well, you keep drinking that JT kool aid. Let us know how things turn out in few years.
Yep, there is no middle ground with Wynne liberals, you are either for them or in the "dark ages," because they can do no wrong. And if monkeys had wings they'd fly out my butt.
The interesting result of low oil prices - we don't need Saudi as much anymoreMaybe there's a silver lining after all
The bias and attempt at social engineering of the mainstream media represents a greater onslaught on the democratic process than social media
Did you miss junior's Key Note Address in the Small Conference Room and his interview with Zakaria?
That's strange, I just saw a graphic in the NYT that stated from 2012- 2016, 57 police officers had been killed and not all by violence.
Somebody please tell me this guy is kidding, I can't tell.
Harper and Associates aren't partisans....they are zealots.
Spend the money on something else. Alberta. Whatever.
you forgot to mention that future TFSA withdrawals will still be subject to GST, so governments will continue to earn money from TFSA's no matter when the money is withdrawn and spent.
Michael Chong would make a fantastic leader.
Now ain't that strange that a lot of people thunk the same about Late Pete and the Jean Jean the Lyin' Machine? Funny how that party thing works, i'n'it?
wally, I'm curious to know how much of your professional and personal time has been spent delving into First Nation issues.
So the pamphlet is polictially correct. What a dreadful waste of paper. Apparently the myth of invincibility because it is my right to be invincible remains. Perhaps the title of the pamphlet should be truncated to remove the words 'and Facts'.
Who is funding BLM? Their nonsense would not be tolerated if Rob Ford was still the Mayor of Toronto.
OK Jeffrey, time to set aside your ego (and your bad toupe).
What is also as Canadian as maple syrup, are immigrants with professional degrees coming to Canada, just to end up drive taxi cabs, before they give up, and emigrate to the States.
They got change? Really? What changed besides the government?
Don't ask, don't tell...
in power they are nothing.....
the US subs are nuclear powered. My goodness, the reactors emit a lot of CO2CO2 !
Martim. The US has not stopped funding to the UN.
Why are comments closed on the "Harper heads north on campaign tour as Duffy trial resumes" article, I wonder ?
True enough, but how do you apply it to jails?
so, senior citizens and the future of the country - youth - cannot vote. interesting.feeling a little 'victimized', are you?
Polygamy is legal in France? Marrying sisters is a bold move for a practising catholic.

You sound like a moon howler.
I don't know where you get your material, but Arab regimes are anything but uniform in their interpretation and application of the Koran and Sharia law. Maybe you could cite the regimes that make up your definition of "most".
Should read 'talk to them or consult them'.
Rome was once the greatest nation/empire in history. Look where they are now. Don't look behind because China is on your tail
Your vision for the future is rather stunted. For the first time in history we are handing our descendants a future more bleak than the one we've enjoyed.
Scrutiny is expected and welcomed. Made up news and wishful thinking disguised and news are neither welcomed or warranted
I completely agree!
'Teachers' are probably a prime reason why Trump got elected !
Thank-you for that information.
So what? What has this got to do with electoral reform?
Fairy tales do come true, but only if you are young at heart.
In Europe, in many classrooms, teachers have stopped teaching about the Holocaust, because it offends their Muslim students. I expect the Globe and Mail will stop writing about the Holocaust at some point. Cowards.
We should dissolve NATO and the UN.
We have all seen Toronto police many times standing together in a circle writing their incident notes.
You see little Peg. Take a clear look at the consistency of bombings in the last few years. None, repeat none have been aimed at those stressed in your opening sentence.
It sounds like a recycled manifesto from the Summer of '68 with newer technology.
Cause they were not there.
Translation of Cassandra's post "LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU"
Um, Stan Duptall just did.
People do live longer now than in the past. Just look up the Human life expectancy patterns. If this keeps up we will all be living to 110 years of age.
PDM12, too subtle for yah? He was talking about Tubby, the Bush wannabe.
It sure depends who you read, neighbor - I was quoting world (European) press. You - I don't know. I don't know if I'd always want to trust WSJ.
despite the disaster that is now Ontario, the sheep will once again give the liberals a majority next election.
It is all Harper's fault, everything is either Harper's fault or Harris's fault as the partisan Con hate shills will tell you, Liberals never are to blame as their sins are due to Harper Federally and Harris in Ontario. Nope, no partisanship there.
'Principled stand'?Trashing 65 years of NDP principles and values, principles and values traditionally respected by all Canadians of all political stripes when they were espoused by David Lewis, Ed Broadbent and Jack Layton.
I feel uncomfortable with extreme displays of religion. They creep me out. I find Islam, in particular to be outright chauvinistic. Sorry, but not everybody shares your views.
Trust-fund's performance in the debates boiled down to "AM NOT AM NOT! " IS TOO IS TOO" .. the guy is as dim as a porch light.
When millions believe blasphemy is punishable by death extremism begins to look like the norm.
C1, the LPC isn't the left.. Nor are the greens for that matter.
What a great title. Pretty much says it all.
oh wow, you're a very hostile and angry person. You should learn to love the Gay! - it will probably save you from an early heart attack or brain aneurysm.
The only clearly good and smart thing Harper ever did was to put up barriers against ebola coming to Canada.
Nicely stated - now I don't have to
And I'm sure Mr. Putin is cowering in the corner, in terror of the bellicose thunderings of Messrs. Harper and Baird.
The PKK is a listed terrorist organization, you won't find any CAF personnel with them. Our guys are training Peshmerga under control of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG).
Thank you!!!!!!
Once upon a time, Rec. Remember the excellent peek into Timmy's, last week ?
What if immigration consultants coached prospective immigrants in the 'correct' answers? I see a business opportunity there.
So JCat....just exactly what has she done that you feel is being forced or wedged into the fabric of Canada?
You have obviously NEVER lived on a farm and have no clue !
Ethic minorities and many villagers are allowed to have more than 1 child.
I think that the current inhabitants of 24 Sussex are construction workers and probably the odd rat and mouse. The latter will be happy with a handful of wheat each day.
Dalton will finally get his wish-- a green province!! All the manufacturing facilities will be overgrown with weeds!!
ugh, barf. These royal parasites disgust me. Sell their castles and make them get real jobs.
Next time you have a medical emergency or fire call Wente and get her to help you.
Is starving to death a 'peaceful death'? I cannot imagine it- but if it is your plan, then of course it is right for you. I want some assistance with my death- and I want to choose the time.
I guess if you gloss over the million people or so dead due to the chaos in Iraq and area due to Obama withdrawing from Iraq before the country had stabilized.
If this story tells us anything, it's that there is no such thing as 'native' and 'non-native'. There are degrees of 'nativeness'.
Yep, thank heaven for that, a rational alternative.
Hey Bud this 'True Canadian' citizen will be storming the gates of the Harper regime - should be a real 'photo op' - have your cameras ready - it's going to be a hoot!
You sir are wrong!
A lot of what you are recommending has been done. You are very ill informed.
#JustNotReady
I will tell you why the Cons/Libs and NDP are afraid to act - they will be labeled as anti-Chinese. And that could't be further from the truth
The Toronto Star tore a strip out of Justin on this one. If even the Toronto Star thinks that Justin was wrong, then he was wrong.
Baird was a nasty piece of work, totally ill-suited for External Affairs or whatever it is now called.
The Editorial Board of G&M is the reason that I don't subscribe. I will occasionally read it on computer as I will purchase a paper at the convenience store but I cannot support the foolish policies of the publshers
Be careful of being to smug. There's always someone with a bigger gun or gang that'll spoil your best laid plans.
Aunt Pittipat, where are your smelling salts?
Intelligent comment??????
Dear Preston, Please. Pack your bag, hop on your horse, and ride off into the sunset. You are yesterday's meatloaf.
Really poor article. The writer uses a catastrophe in Fort Mac as a launching pad for her dislike of an American politician. Possibly the worst article I've seen in quite a while.
The question is how many greedy, short-sighted voters are there?
If you hear the sound of giggling, it's because your wit is showing, and, well, it's not very impressive.
Only Snowy would call this a war... then again Liberals never stood up to serve Canada, they just palm serve themselves
Cameron had his concessions. He wasn't angling for more. I expect we'll be very happy with our decision. You, on the other hand, will miss the second largest contributor to your coffers.
you can't build a country by having 12 little countries in a country
Yeah Art, they had it coming. Collective punishment. Collective guilt.
even a broken clock is right twice a day.
What great timing!!!!! Just in time for an election!!! Does this mean there's still hope for the fading middle class? Will organized labour get back everything it's been forced to give up? Let democracy reign!!!!
"racist" LOL! Deploy the logical fallacy, (ie 'You hate dogs therefore you must be a cat lover')
Dude, a) Some of us on the right despise Harperb) Not everybody breaks Godwin's Lawc) articles on here are not written just so we can commentd) If you think its only the left that hates in this country you have not been looking in the mirror
Ok, then could you explain to me why a teaching Prof, no credentials in the field, non PHD, sorry don?t know the terms, the guy teachers a couple of courses a week, no PHD. Yet he is on the sunshine list at over $120K per year.
This is the type of article that needs to be shared with everyone. It's not so much a discrimination against women, it's more a discrimination against having a family/children.
Nor does he seem aware that there is no pipeline to either of these ports that can or will transport bitumen
Lack of practice. Women talk more than men, and are therefore better at it.
Except that these criminally-aggressive and deadly regimes were all that kept intransigent religious factions from killing each other. Too often has the removal of a dictator resulted in a battle for religious superiority or outright theocracy.
If you really knew anything about health, Ms Wente, you would know that contracting the childhood diseases (symptomatic or, just as often, unsymptomatic) has global health benefits. Nothing is better for your health than getting sick.
I couldn't agree with you more!
Is that you Marcus?
'If anything this piece suggest the immigrants are bringing the country up, not down,'Bingo!
Those issues hardly showed up this year.
It would be 'nice' ?For whom?
Well said. Ultimately it comes down to recognising that not one of us is perfect; we all screw up, and knowing that, need to be skeptical of our own claims as well as those of anyone else, male or female.
In what universe is a wild bear 'cute and cuddly' And that's just the beginning of problems with your analysis.
The provinces - you elect the mlas - teh feds - you elect the mps - are involved. Do you really want 33 million other voices? Because that's a really good way for discussions to never, never end. Please, not referenda on every political decision.
Conservatives need not make a premature choice - there is plenty of time. Ambrose does not impress me but McKay is poison.
Check your stats, because they're way out of date. $100k+ is rapidly becoming the norm.
Why is it that so many religious people can't distinguish between what's their business and what's someone else's?
Everybody knows that Eve Adams is toast and I'm surprised that the Liberals would risk placing her in a riding they know they won't win. The only thing that Ms Adams has going for her are her good looks and unfortunately that won't win elections.
'Here in Canada, your income level has very little impact on your access to decent schools, good health care and safe neighbourhoods.'Whaa?
Gateway is dead. Everybody knows it except a few Albertans. Time to move on to a sustainable economy.
As world largest robbed land country, your logic is quite ridiculous.
The Russians and the Chinese are no worse, just different, and probably wiser. ISIS is a fashionable local nothing, except that the Americans created it in their own image.
If Obama's hope and change didn't work, then neither will this.
I call him Prime Minister Stephen Little Fingers.
Alberta legislature does not have an accreditation for journalists.
That's why I included premiers in the list.
that policy is marginal for Canadian voters as a whole
Feminists grimace a lot when they type this sort of s**t!
Complete lack of respect for her constituency; That should be the headline. Did the voters choose her as someone to lead the NDP? She should resign, and then run in the by-election for the NDP. Of course we know the strength of her convictions.
Shouldn't that be 'u' ?
Your so smart Tom, nothing gets by you.
It's a "personal choice" to not have a beard down to your stomach?
The federal people are too busy making selfies these days, so too busy to make decisions.
Bob, I believe in climate change. The point is that when someone starts linking every weather event to it without proof for that particular event people become more cynical. And rightfully so. Fear mongering is a form of extremism.
The inner city she thought she had in her pocket stayed on their side of the tracks.
It's 'crepitations.'
So I'm a loser because you don't like what I've written? A tree that is inflexible snaps in two while the tree that bends in the wind survives and prospers.
If the PM was truly a friend of young Canadians he would bring back mandatory retirement. Young people cant get on the career ladder because the boomers will not retire!
"Respectfully speaking there is NO inferior aircraft to the F-35 when it comes to the air superiority role" =================================================== Really? What do you get these ideas from?
I think it's called "selective denial". Kinda like the Stockholm syndrome.
Yes, it is just a little irresponsible for a reporter to be published (even if it is opinion) with so little research, no?
The problem is 'she' isn't choosing. Does religious freedom for her husband trumpt her personal freedoms?
Your attacks on people posting are similarly annoying.
Didn't take the GM long to bury this article.
Believe Marg. Ur one of the few that will.
Checks and balances are in the constitution, not some commie red manifesto of social justice.
I don't get this reasoning. How is he charging the public? Did he reroute public funds to pay for his nanny? How is anything that he does with his own paycheck any of your business?
I dislike the "well said" kind of comments but Terry from NL has covered the ground perfectly
They don't care about respect, they'd rather lose respect and gain huge salaries, benefits and pensions, thank you very much.
ZAnd after all of our income-generating businesses are closed, we will live on what? Oxygen? It may be free, but we won't be able to afford even that.
Too funny. Knowing harper, you're probably right.
@stp1111 "jc12345. If you spray a bunch of bullets at a deer " This is not an automatic weapon therefore there is no "spraying". You don't really seem to know what you are talking about.
please please pleaseput these two out to pasture
'The United States is a benign factor'Yeah, when they're not busy arming head-chopping and liver-eating jihadis to carry out their vile regime-change plans that are responsible for this whole conflict. Go Russia!
Readers of The Dogs Are Eating Them Now find it difficult/impossible to justify Canada's military involvement and ancillary, reprehensible policing actions there.
Actually, it's the lack of evidence for the existence of any god that makes one an atheist. Belief has nothing to do with it.
You left out these, all from comments on this thread:'fascists''unelected judges''Junior''LIB propaganda''in your subsidized apartment ''criminal's paradise''sharia law''Bob Rae'That's (ahem) 8 for me. ;-)
'420 million tons of CO2 per year by 2020' what's that in ppm? because that is how CO2 is measured in the atmosphere.
Donald J. Trump ?@realDonaldTrump 1 hour agoMany of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
I am not sure about this decision , I am afraid of 'mission creep' but once our forces are engaged every Canadian will back them and hope and pray there will be no body bags coming home.
To imagine that the action of Baird and Harper had on recent events in Iran is quite delusional..
Exactly right, and the majority of the Con Caucus even agree. It's the last time in a long time you'll see the OntCons run a despot for Premier.
You just proved my point.
Or she can stand up and leave. It certainly did not sound like he was overly aggresve or threatening
Much like guys who wear ridiculous toupees.
Who is this comment directed at?If you're talking about LIbs, you should know the NDP lead in Ottawa and Toronto overall votes mostly conservative now.
rude and disgusting is a matter of opinion.
Look at the federal map of seats for Ontario... Gee...where is the lieberal strong hold? The center of the universe - Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me OR the people of the GTA are just plain stupid.
Probably when their per capita COX load approaches Canada's.
Not to mention Harper is the most anti-science leader in the West.
Usually the posters display more intelligence and diversity ....
D. - He no longer has any control over these matters.
Disguise? What Liberal government has ever been prudent. Thus the term, Tax and Spend Liberal.
Yes grown ups like you US Americans have there, Donald Trump for example.
Why is it so tough for recent governments to understand they have to obey our Law of the Land? Its like they think they're on a boat and they're the Captain.
This is 2016. Get over it. We learn from our mistakes. Christy is an exception to that rule.
when hell freezes over, maybe.
Edit: First line should read '... $5.5 million in salary and benefits ...'
I agree with our liberal partisan posters, I don't like this bill because a conservative government has introduced it. Had Trudeau introduced this, I'd love it.
Look again ...oh and clean your glasses first.
No, spelling and grammer is the last defence of someone who just lost!
Muslims are delusional freaks. Don't let them in.
I D I O T!
If they have yet to be released, how do you even know about them, or that they're "the best of the best"? ... Yeah, thought so.
She isn't really a faculty member. She is bucking for tenure. This is CV padding.
Linda, JT taught math. He did one semester as a drama teacher replacing a colleague on maternity leave.
China has a national carbon tax starting in 201710 US states have a carbon tax and more are coming soonWho else you got? India? Yup they are also going down this path
Bah Humbug!
For the same reason people dislike Harper for hiding information.
'Crowing' is exactly the right words to describe the NDP's cynical move. So now, if I may ask, could anyone tell me what the third option (MMP) is?I understand the PR and the STV systems but know nothing about the MMP. Anyone??
Delusional much? I think you had better do some serious research before posting such nonsense.
Dartguard, do you really think it's a positive trait to humiliate reporters who ask legitimate questions on behalf of Canadians? Really that's a plus in your world?
Let people start claiming quotas by randomly picking sex/colour/etc. Lefties would start a civil war.
If the employers offered decent wages and living conditions, they wouldn't need cheap foreign workers.
Do not forget the French Revolution. The French people killed their king Louis XVI due to what they saw happening in their country. The French people are rising again.
Better than sitting on your hands doing nothing.
the truth of the matter is that no poitician , federal or provincial has the courage to seriously address our options around private care because it would cost them too many votes
So declined millions try to move there every year.
Spot on, RT. Baldwin sending his children to live with the LaFontaines in Lower Canada so that they could communicate in French and better understand the culture was for me the most remarkable of events of the political pairing.
Like JT's dad, it's the female vote that will get him elected, plus the vote of those males who also find him 'pretty'. That's the biggest block of voters anyone can have. The PC's should go looking for a Chippendale to replace Harper.
diane marie, Ain't that the truth!
Chretien also gets a trunk load of golf balls each year to go with his pension.
Cannabis legalization is, or at least can be ' Simple, stroke-of-a-pen stuff'. All that is needed from the federal government is to get out of the way so that the provinces can get on with regulation.
The first sentence is somewhat accurate, but would be better if amended to....'Stephen Harper was passionate about 'his interpretation of' Canadian history'
The dictators in the arab world were all mostly secular in nature and not a threat to the west. Some of them did have a problem with Israel and other countries in the Middle East but they were not lethal. Now what we have is a mess. Its so sad.
I actually like walking to the community mailboxes to get my mail. I also don't have to worry about a mail carrier slipping on my front steps. If some people want home delivery so bad, then perhaps it could be offered for an annual fee?
You endorsed Frod too as I recall.
Either way 2015's 'Heave Steve Day' can't come quickly enough.
Thanks. A timely article.
I think that's the whole point of this crisis, coming up the pipeline are a whole whack of people without pensions that are going to need GIS, a whole lot more than today.
Actually all it takes is to say you are ( and of course label yourself a Conservative) and Harper's base will swallow it all hook, line and sinker.
He wouldn't be able to work at McDonald's -he'd get stuck in the arch trying to get in.
Many good points. Nonetheless, there are of problems with 'career politicians' who game the system to retain their power. Perhaps there should be a limit on the number of times one can run for office.
My wife's forbears, Acadians settled in what is now Nova Scotia about 1615, and have been here ever since......
'I wish someone would add up the numbers'The purpose of a pilot project is to get those numbers.
Why? It's less expensive than deportation.
Not so fast there... Dr. Leitch is not so out of touch with one half of the population.// ..
Nothing to do with Harper. The law dates from 1993. Harper-hatred and ignorance seem to go hand in hand.
Excellent satire. You coulda wrote for Leno.
The president should not be making a display of supporting Hillary and this judge has no business criticizing Trump. These people are way out of line. Many dislike Trump and Hillary but some things are just unfair.
Canada had a McCarthy Era?
How about capitalist swine exploiters of the proletarian working class ....
Looks like Bercuson got his loyalists/students to thumb down the comments. Notice they thumb down the many comments elaborating on the subject and undermining his article, but they don't actually make any counter-points.
''Native Land' is the land of one's nativity, which makes the vast majority of Canadians natives. Time to toss this outmoded imperialist anachronism.
Your father, Eugene Forsey, was an example of the qualities and service that Senators should aspire.
Lester Pearson epitomized Canadian values on the world stage. Harper makes a mockery of them. The worst prime minister in living memory.
Saint John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI spoke often of environmental stewardship. Good for Pope Francis to write an encyclical about it though.
Yes experience is great. But not eight years of recurring disastrous and very destructive experience! Canadians deserve an urgent change to more cumulative positive experience.
I don't much read these commentaries any more, I just read the brief CV of the Globe and Mail's SJW-du jour; likewise, this one.
and they were right
What does 'uni ethnically owned' mean?
When the Liberals got into power the debt was 34 million, it is now close to 60 million. I find it really amazing the people believe that this government are good fiscal managers.
Looking forward to his slogans 'Stop the Lying Crackhead' or 'Respect for Moral People'
fords chief of staff wouldnt give a crap right now about secondary fallout like the school lockdown,,,,he would be looking at the main crisis,,,,Jaye Robinson, a member of the Mayor's executive committee,,,,enough
The fully auto thing along with some radical natives, watch out.
So would Hillary or Cuz. You only say what is pedestrian.
MMackinnon, you go first and share an explanation for this "And the extreme right has been shown up, again and again, to be fundamentally not playing by the same rules." duh?
Given his business and negotiating experience, Trump would easily be a much better leader than Obama. Meanwhile we have Junior here in Canada who is an empty shell.
I guess Wente's repeated odes to the trades weren't particularly sincere. Somebody should let her know that just because some people shower after work instead of before doesn't mean they have a few beers at lunch.
Iran is doing it too. Not to excuse the Saudis, but its not just them
I'm sorry, where did Mr. Simpson get his science degree?
WhoDat is by far the best thing to happen to the provincial Liberals in a very long time.
Grow up....
Appreciate your input Mrs. Mulcair but you are delusional. It's on your boy Tom.

All that you write here is not in any particular way a demonstration of why Trump is wrong, but merely why you don't get it.
Touche Russ, Touche.
Outside, not inside. Jeesh. Pretending not to see Islam's obsession with women's "modesty" not only fools no one, it makes you look hypocritical.
Harper has not got a diplomatic bone in his body. How insulting to state that ' we will not take no for an answer' with regards to Keystone. Not exactly team building.
well it wasnt the usa loser
Why does nobody care about the Chinese occupation of Tibet since 1951 and their importation of many ethnic Chinese (Han) to outnumber the Tibetans ?
Hey Captain, fix Ontario first. It's your mess.
If Trudeau had a compelling vision and flawless campaign why did the Liberals only get 39% of the vote and only 7% more than the Conservatives. Most Canadians voted against Trudeau's compelling vision. Let's not get carried away.
The author displays a very narrow and simplistic understanding of the root causes of terrorism.
teabagging is not exclusively homosexual - anyone with balls can do it to another.

The Queen's kids should hold another one this week. Flip the bird to the insecure world.
You mean with the 30+ years of extra life expectancy we now have, you'll give science-based medicine the thumbs up?
Here-here. I agree w/ you totally. It is time to leave that worthless money vacuum!
you're forgeting about 2008 aka the worst financial crisis since the great depression....duhhhh
I never hear or read an explanation of what believers think will result if various prohibited behaviours are indulged in. If boys and girls meet and touch on the soccer field, what calamity will ensue?
But more of a tax grab.
Are you being confronted with any argument to the contrary? Hope not.
Another data point on why BLM Canada is such a ridiculous farce. Are you paying attention Mr Doug Saunders.
Not everybody is allowed to come into Canada !
Honouring the victims of communism does unite most Canadians as polling suggests. What would the Globe and its fellow travelers prefer? A Walter Duranty Memorial?

another utterly stupid comment. He has a wife, he has a loving family, so obviously someone likes his personality.
Mighty white of Bliss to throw our allies in eastern Europe under the bus because it doesn't jibe with his favourite political philosopher's theory.
Winehouse's fate has some educational value. Although since Ford doesn't seem to have learned anything from being around people who've been beaten, thrown off balconies, shot, jailed and/or imprisoned, maybe he's a particularly slow learner.
When someone tries to tell you to disbelieve what you see and hear and with your own eyes and ears, there's a better than even chance they're selling you a bill of goods.
Not gonna be friends with isis, not now, not ever. Take that how you will, appeasement isn't a solution.
Good point Steven. The four president you mentioned all were involved in destroying countries. However Eisenhower and Clinton only bought destruction to other countries, nor their own.
BS Earl, they were working in High River for weeks after the flood.
Pierre Trudeau was a pompous as* and guess who is following in his footsteps.
Roses are red, Violets are blue, Clovers are green, Justin Trudeau is an idiot.

'Police arrest 900 Syrians in England and Wales for crimes including rape and child abuse' - Express, 31 July More 'news you wont read in the G&M' or a Yakster piece.
I am not familiar with this international convention but usually a Party has to serve some kind of notice of its intentiion to withdraw; has notice been served and what is the effective date of Canada's withdrawal ?
Better it be a bomb or missile sent from a manned aircraft? You really cannot believe this.
What's particularly terrifying is that at some point, these clowns are going to graduate and enter the job market - or maybe not, if we're lucky.
How so? Muslims are held to the same standards if thats your question. I.e., they must also provide the service or refer to someone else. no religion gets a pass
Let's get our niqab on!
Israeli talking points.
I'm not sure when ideologue and ethical became synonymous.
The same argument works for men: High flying career man $$$ = No time for family lifeTaking time out of career to spend more time with the family = Career suicide and less $$.That is not an argument unique to women whatsoever.
Ha...but really: what gives Toronto? Mel Lastman wasn't dumb enough?

"Liberals are Liberals, be they provincial or federal;" Unless they're BC Liberals?, right?
We have Rick Mercer, who can give it to politicians, as he does on his CBC show.
Lets get the G&M to sponsor a photo contest for all of Canada this spring, when the snow is all gone. Submit pictures of the roads and streets in a reservation or indian settlement you visit. the winner gets an autographed picture of chief Spence.
m'Lord also liked Rob Ford .... and wrote a glowing book about Nixon.. just in case some readers missed the implication of your statement
Free trade is a good thing for the educated, elite, professional class. Not so much for the average Jo and Joanne.
I wonder if some of the inhabitants of the Jerusalem will attempt to block Harper's path through the old city.
The votes here are whacked.
He gets a dollar for every time someone on the internet accuses him of being Hitler.
But Stew, you have already written on this blog that the CBC is a 'state broadcaster'. So therefore it is a right-wing Harper propaganda broadcaster, Harper clearly representing the current 'state' and being undeniably right-wing.
Value added taxes are far smarter, more transparent and more egalitarian than input or sales taxes....they make business sense, which is why the first to propose it was a business man....Dr Wilhelm von Siemens...
You need to get in out of the rain SC. You're rusting.
It must have been the catchy new campaign slogan:'Canadas liberals: Because punishing the hard working 1% is easier than becoming hard workingand we also promise LEGAL WEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
I said they "think" they have a monopoly, not that they have a monopoly!
I would say that Harper has been a caretaker PM who has just been treading water to retain power. Look back over his tenure - what big initiatives has he accomplished? Hardly anything? Is there a comparable PM in our history on that front?
Let's face it Harper is simply a manipulating bully. Vote in 2015 to get rid of this scum.
Our manufacturing jobs were chased out of Canada by greedy businesses capitalizing on obscenely low wages in third world countries ...not unions.
You can't use logic and reason with people who didn't use it to arrive at their conclusion.
Good luck selling 2 cents per gallon more as a climate change tax to American consumers, let alone $2 per gallon/50 cents per litre.
Imbeciles, morons and losers whose empty lives are enriched by the concept of hereditary privilege.
Harper's conduct is heinous.
Actually pre-school.
As much as you marxists like to think that you have exclusive license on all that is good, you don't.In fact ,your attitudes are major contributors to poverty, crime,and ,yes environmental degradation.
Excellent analysis. Black Lives Matters missed their opportunity to extort the para olympics.
Care to explain? Which one of his other ideas do you find distasteful?
The wind turbines Cosmic Wheels shows operated from 1987 to 2006 and were removed in 2012. A smaller number of larger turbines were installed at a nearby site.
He's against the English curriculum, too.
Unfortunately, players get paid in U.S. dollars. That puts Canadian franchises at a distinct disadvantage. Until the Maple Peso gets off the mat there won't be any more Canadian teams. Let's just hope we can hold on to the one's we have.
They are not immigrants, Dubai does not have immigrants.
I've never liked Hillary but she's still preferable to any of the potential GOP candidates we've seen. The author is right; voting for her will be like sticking hot pokers in my eyes.
New ideas everywhere else, same old, very old Globe editorial dept. The people of Ontario have spoken; and obviously the Globe is completely unable to hear them or think about the message.
News Flash: Canada Declares Profits Top PriorityDemocracy Not So MuchNo. No.I better not post this. Someone might take it for today's fake news. LOL
Harper, former President of the National Citizens Coalition, took aim at the Macdonald legacy.
I can only assume that the G&M wants to destroy any remaining credibility it has in Alberta by profiling commentators such as Smith who have even less credibility than the G&M, itself. And by the way, it's working.
As do you follower, socialist.
Of course there are more and deeper potholes in Qu?bec than ROC in total!
Neither is a climate scientist, neither presents sound arguments and neither has hesitated to ascribe low motives to those they disagree with.
Bring it on!
The AESO in Alberta sets market rules for TransCos and DisCos as well, and the AUC regulates the whole sha-bang. It's not really a wild west out here. But this story sure makes it sound like it is.
46% of Americans also believe God created humans within the last 10,000 years. www. gallup.com/poll/155003/Hold-Creationist-View-Human-Origins.aspxso nice they are less divided in their belief in Canada than their belief in evolution. i guess.
Meanwhile, the warmongers over at the National Post are howling for more bombing and bloodletting. They are definitely well paid members of the Defense Industry as well as being Cheney and Bush fans.
The west did not support that lunatic. The US air force actually tried to kill him, and did kill some of his kids.
Nobody is addressing the effects of Globalization & technology. Its a different world out there and too many both left & right have their heads up their a$$es not to acknowledge it. Its not a matter of left wing or right wing politics anymore.
Absolutely correct .
Wow! I find myself actually agreeing with you. Never thought that would happen.
Her power base as it increasingly is for the 'left ' is public service unions
And I'm not sure why you consistently employ irrelevant pedantry rather than contributing to the discussion.
You don't seriously expect anybody to believe this do you? I'm still waiting to hear what Fordnation means by "elite" Does elitism mean thinking?
Western politicians were quite right to support the people of Ukraine when they overthrew Moscow's man in Kyiv.
@LL7 ? Because partisan symbolism has no business on the front lawn of the Supreme Court.
They invaded and set up a bloody oligarchy dictatorship in Guatemala, for bananas.
I see they are now banning belly dancing on Egyptian t.v. Next will be attacks on the Egyptian pyramids.
I agree. I voted for my Liberal candidate, don't even remember this campaign promise, and can't imagine it swayed many votes.
why would the globe and mail give this lying #$#$%^^* a forumto rewrite his history of mistakes, lies, and outright incompetence?
The mud thrower at the globe asking Mayor Ford to be submissuve to the Lying Lefties. I think not. Keep standing up to these sore losers Mayor Ford. We are proud of you !!!
You were doing pretty well until the fairy tale about the US. I would assert that all parties have a range of opinions represented within them and it is a bit odd to pretend that there exists the possibility of a completely homogeneous party.
The end of the Commonwealth and the Francophoniewould be a good thing; at least the end of Canada'sparticipation and funding of these outdated clubs thatare mostly populated by basketcase countries.
Do other languages have words for 'xenophobia' and 'racism'? Do they even acknowledge such things? I'm pretty tired of reading the English versions.
Three cases of American goat pee is not worth one case of Canadian beer.
I am a great supporter of well-paid jobs IF THE WORKER DESERVES ITMerit and educationNot well paid just because it is a government union job
Yeah, but if you were, they'd make you sit beside HIM!
What does 'outside the metropolis' mean ???? What you smokin' ???
XKR:$40k doesn't buy you much in today's economy. I doubt you could pay for rent, bills, insurance, fuel, groceries and prescriptions on that low of an income.
Maybe it should be the other way around then. Try to incentivize youngish already-married doctors with families to move.
Wrong. For the past 12 years, from 2003 to 2015, NL had a majority conservative government provincially.
It is within his Charter rights to say "thank god". Would you have criticized if he said praise allah?
And all the evidence sbows that the current system js working fine.
The US had 150 000 last year from Central Americans dumping kids on their doorsteps
Interesting that you assume a law targeting convicted terrorists is an attack on your people.
She doesn't have the guts to block the budget. it is all bluff. so sadly, we are stuck with the liberals for some time. Then both ndp and libs are toast at the next election.
If you read the article, you would see that he cites a family home. Based on that, he could cast a ballot in Compton-Stanstead.
Don't sleep alone on your birthday.
hahaha. You should get some sleep.
Well, aren’t we just a ray of frigging sunshine.
Bang-on. This editorial sounds like the worst of sore-loser tripe.
Your kidding right? 35miles?
Without an alternative, Newfoundland and Labrador have almost no bargaining power. , now or in the future. The cost of the undersea cable is small relative to the increase in bargaining power that it will give NL.
But then who's going to sweep your floors and clean your toilets?
Maybe the problem goes back further.
Like Galileo vs Church.
wasn't there earlier - must have been added in the 3:01 PM EST update. And the G&M header comment does not change the fact that nowhere in his article did Bob Rae acknowledge or even mention his conflict of interest
If you can't figure it out by yourself, what makes you think we can make you any smarter?

Chretien had an undeniable appeal-have to like a politician who takes care of his own protesters. Shawinigan handshake anyone?
Yeah but the irony is wasted on the folks at the Globe.
You must be either a) a child of a mother who drank while you were in the womb or b) dropped on your head very soon after or c) just one of the brain dead Ford fans that hang out at the Tim Hortons.
'Majority rule'?Whereabouts is that at?
excuses excuses excuses
You may not have the goals, but liberal policies will have this maybe unintended result. Ask the native people about pre and post-contact eras.
Roach has never posted anything intelligent in his career here....
I certainly hope so, because they have been asleep for the past 11 years.
Laughable. Harper haters wouldn't thank him, even if he saved their lives.
You don't even realize how stupid your comment is ---- do you? LOL You are clueless about who the indictments were for or you would not have made the comment you did.
Jus soli. Latin for 'right of the soil' If you are born in a US hospital, on US ground, you are a US citizen.
So vote for someone who's going to refuse her citizenship because of her belief. And you have seen interviews with women for whom it is her choice to wear a niqab. Right ?
Seems rather like the decision to equip officers with body cameras. Sounds cool, lets do it. Instant ripoff though. Cost for the Metropolitan Police is three times what it cost to equip the Met Police in London and you get fewer cameras too!
An honest man would be ashamed to have his name on this article.
To add to your list, in the mid 60s a weekly magazine ran a cover feature asking, 'Are we raising a generation of spoiled brats?'
I live in Quebec and I know it depends on who uses them, and how.
So, only old people die?
And just how would that ever be enforced with any confidence of integrity whatsoever! Your post is the perfect example of why our rights and freedoms are disappearing. You rationalize it for them (and for us). No thank you mog_man!
tea party? sounds like you and Tom should hold hands and walk down commie lane in the night. Apparently to the new communist party one doesn't have the freedom to have a say on how their hard earned money is spent... wow
That jobs in whch women predominate are lower paying is also part of the gender gap. Its not an either/or.
Don't we have enough cab drivers?
It is disappointing to you when an article doesn't conform to your beliefs isn't it?
You have a choice. Don't read it. Don't buy it.Exercise your critical faculty.
Lots of spewing just like Spence, hiding in the dark while your Leader does NOTHING and neither do YOU!
But at least your grandchildren will have government baby-sitters that are receiving a high wage that comes from borrowed money.
According to Ms. Wente, there is no recession right now. Just great buying opportunities on the TSX right now, I suppose.
So that's six trillion over how many decades? Lucky the economy generates two trillion a year to pay those unfunded liabilities.
How have the Liberals 'brought back' public service.
If the Tories viewed (possibly correctly) immigrants as socially conservative and therefore Tory voters, why did the Harperites fall flat on their faces in the last general ? Seems a lot of immigrants voted Liberal.
Why on earth would you possibly need to 'moderate my last (3-word) comment?
What you Conservative hucksters always mean is 'big city elite.'

Excellent points all around gentlemen. The social engineering in schools is nothing short to gender cleansing.
Note to self: Read ER more often. Her clever humour rocks.
The G&M placed my response on the wrong thread. They need to get a decent comment programme.
Vote her out and then vote who in? Conservatives? We've barely recovered from all the damage done by Mike Harris. The NDP? Please no.I'm sick of all of them. They are all full of b.s. and hypocrisy. I vote Green.
Put your glasses on. The whole comment section reeks of racism
Sounds like someone else needs help . . .

Why would you assume that our government will grow a pair? If water export becomes a big enough commercial enterprise our government will probably subsidize it.
Mr. Khadr has spoken and very loud when he was preparing improvised explosives and teaching -proudly- other how to build the devices. Why would you discriminate the other inmates, if he deserve to talk, why not others?
It has nothing to do with religion and it shows disrespect for the country of which she wishes to be a citizen.
Comey sounds a lot like our disgraced RCMP commissioner, Giuliano Zaccardelli, back when he slimed Ralph Goodale by announcing a phoney investigation during an election campaign.
It's happening, deal with it.
Surely you jest! I don't want MY Canada looking to Quebec for anything unless it is being used as an example of how NOT to do something. What a laughable suggestion!
Why didn't he go? Simple, the PMO analysis concluded that he would not gain any incremental standings in the polls which of course is the motive behind all of his decisions.
What? This smells Nazis!
They both sport a nice head of hair - but only one had a hairdresser constantly on hand. Past tense, one assumes, now that the coiffure's importance has been diminished somewhat, out of the limelight, so to speak ?
Being of the governmental class, Frances objects to salary disclosures of the governmental class.
PM Butts won't mind, unfortunately neither of them seem interested in addressing anything important..
This argument in its many variants has been made in the U.S. for the past 30 years and implemented by the Republicans as part of their program to reduce taxes for the wealthy. The result can be seen in the ever expanding income gap there.
No, can't be. It just a conservative point of view from a paper that supports them.
slack jawed yokel?
I dare you to back up that statement with facts.
Canada1 is utterly beneath contempt for those disgusting and traitorous comments. May he get what he desreves, inshallah.
mulclair will likely not get re elected as Federal NDP leader. but yes that is an issue for another day. first task is wiping out the neo-cons in victoria.
A doctor will tell you the same thing. Difference being that one is based on scientific research, the other on 'energy'. Thanks for proving the point.
Clearly you have never worked in the US.We have made very different policy decisions from them because they are not like us.
You ought to amplify what you define as western civilization, the manner in which I is being destroyed and who the culprits are.
Three thumbs down for Roger Gagne, but no one can come up with an argument against what Bev Dahlby has got to say? Shocking, that.
If you mean in the US, i agree. I think it matters MUCH less in Canada. Thank zeus.
Ford was on drugs, is Justin having THC withdrawals or is he bipolar. Theirs no doubt he feels sorry for his action so why did he lose control?
Newstalk1010 - a 0.130 blood alcohol level corresponds to 8 - 10 drinks! Thats a lot of bull. First of all, if you drank 8-10 drinks in 2 hours you would be on the floor, probably with your head in a toilet.
But watch what you post about that particular horsey set, just in case, in the (hopefully short) scary era of C-51.
Couldn't agree with you more.
Be ready for your property value to drop 50% than! Are you really?
I really doubt that.
If Ukraine had kept its nukes, Yanukovych would have had them, right?
fur, Please elaborate upon what is implied in your phrase 'you need solve the facts'. Hopefully, you don't mean that brown and poor people should simply be kept out.
"Capitalism creates poverty for the masses and wealth for the few." Totally wrong, but you know that. Is your purpose to troll here?
Not the same guy.
Rockin' Rio, way to take bigred's comment to an absurd, hyperbolic conclusion. Although I kind of expect rebuttals like this. I know that Wente's article has made the Harper hating crowd furious and hysterical with this one.
WOW, and they did it all by themselves without the interference of eco-hypocrites from the Green Party !
John we've talked about this... I have you on ignore why do you continue to respond to my posts? A reflection of your intellect no doubt.
Yeah, what is up with that? I feel like I'm clad in a burkha all summer compared to my female colleagues' attire.
On Harper's #ENEMYLIST ? Hell... that's a Badge of Integrity!
Most religious folk are just fine. ShoniiTinon sounds like a bigot, though.
Darth Vader or Vlad the Impaler? Hard to tell.
Mr Trudeau is an embarrassment to the Liberal Party. Can you imagine Bob Rae looking so scared in the House of Commons.
Any evidence for you claim Andre?
Please don't use 'progressive left', it's like an oxymoron. The left offers nothing new under the sun. Most of what the left ideology offers we already tried before Roman civilisation.
Learn the fine art of paragraph breaks. It would make your rants easier to read.

I bet you only read the dust jacket if that much.
But wait - it is the government who sets the work, not the bureaucrats who choose what they will do.
We did vote for sunny ways. We are getting what we deserve.
For an extended discussion of the state of government in Canada try reading Donald Savoie's 'What is Government Good At: A Canadian Answer'.
Oh, come on if we go down this road with Quebec there is no reason why Richmond, BC can't do the same with a majority population being South Asian. Hey, why not Surrey BC next?

How do you force corporations to spend money without draconian taxes?
Stop fear mongering like a neocon. Be happy climate change wasn't a real crisis.
That is the problem, we have seen Steve's record and it is terrible....7 consecutive deficits, an erosion of democracy, and attack on anyone with a view counter to his....anyone but Harper please
Profundity like this can lead to a job in right wing think tanks - or perhaps you are already there? Chin up.
What 'most' Canadians wanted at one point or didn't is not necessarily what they might want in the future, SSM being a case in point. Opinions can change and change quite quickly.
Any law that makes it illegal for Canadian citizens to bring something legally purchased in Canada across Provincial borders makes an absolute mockery of our country. What are we, a free country or a loosely connected set of banana republics?!
His official and entirely counter-to-regulations unilingual card....
Yeah Candace--100 % agree--wish you were the energy minister !

Yes, and the court's findings? Or the evidence that it had a material impact on the electoral outcomes? The bar for whether the GG should step in is pretty high....
You may as well eliminate any contact sport then.
Gun free zone? You might want to visit Toronto, my friend. There are illegal handguns all over this city. Liberal politicians here are more concerned about the 'civil rights' of criminals than protecting law biding citizens.
That makes sense, although I didn't recognize any of the particpants, except in the general 'look' many shared (that eerie 'we're proud to be mad nutters' expression).
then i take it you don't listen to the CBC edoil1
Why is it that the Globe and Mail only allows posts that are in agreement with the author's point of view?
Keep your guns America, you know they want to take them!
And that NAMBLA member and founder of the ReformaCons. Cons wouldn't know balance if you hit them with a scale.
The former parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health...
Your comment is why the justice system doesn't like prior bad acts as evidence. I wonder about all the people posting who have apparently never done anything stupid or embarrassing in their lives. Cast the first stone. And make it a boulder.
The irony is that the niqab was imposed on women in Saudi and Iran around the time of the Iranian revolution, but now those who oppose it in this country are somehow suppressing women's rights.
That writer (if you can even call her that), is terrible! Please stop publishing her trash!
Have you been smoking Ford's crack?
Gee, this is source of racism. Why didnt the rest of us see this
Amnesty International is, in my opinion, so political, dogmatic and doctrinaire as to be significantly anti-social. Of course, they think they are on the side of the angels.
The Globe always sides with business and is against intervention except when it comes to fighting in hockey. Then all of a sudden the Globe board morphs into anti free market granola munching interventionists.
You seem upset. Maybe your wife's little fling is just a phase....

I'm surprised the Quebec authorities gave a damn about damage to a historic mansion that was built as a house for a rich anglo and then used as a private club for more rich anglos.
So giving the Chinese absolute power over us is better?
Of course life was only good for whites in the old S.A. But the end of apartheid sure did not produce the good life for all that had been promised, either. Now it seems everyone is equally miserable.
You are living proof of Canada's need to not follow America's path into a twisted caricature of a democratic nation.
No I think a Justine tough talk speech would be epic, probably make you tube. No substance at all..
Democracy is an ever changing factor in the evolution of a society. The Spartans and Athenians had different views but rallied together against a common enemy.
Not everyone can grow 4 plants and it's probably safe to assume the majority of Canadians can't start a mini grow-op for a multitude of reasons.
Dalton McGinty is not running for mayor; thus, the choice is not between him and Rob Ford. Any of Rob Ford's principal rivals would be better.
an intelligent earnest individual who ran a largely positive campaign? if you think that's a bad thing then you deserve whatever canidate wins.
Georgy, Oil Sands, full speed ahead.
Are you kidding? You did notice that author posted her picture with the article? Why post a picture if others aren't to look at it, to assess what it means to them? I see a woman emulating Bozo the clown, but she got the colours wrong.

You need to recognize get rid of more colonial constructs.
Climate change is not part of the NEB mandate, pipelines are just a mode of transportation. The NEB would have no say if the same amount of oil was shipped by rail.
It is all about the optics. Especially in the eyes of our allies, all of whom have pledged to ramp-up the effort, not ratchet it down. A public display of spinelessness by our new PM on the world stage, for sure.
Yes we need some input from the empty vessel, Justin Trudeau.
Sorry, stupid auto correct.
Harper 'wins by keeping the others down' describes his approach to pretty much everything.
Should we really pick a voting system that ensures the Liberals will never be removed from government? That doesn't sound like democracy.
Because doctors living in poverty would be beneficial. To nobody at all... What is your problem moosep? Lay it out for us. You obviously have an axe to grind. Out with it!
A sterling example of how math can be used stupidly.
In full flight? Isn't this what a COWARD does? I see Ibbotson stating, I suggest approving, of Harper's 3rd time proroguing Parliament, out of fear that his mindset has not been beguiling the electorate anymore.
PR means legislators chosen from party lists, beholden only to the parties, representing no-one except the parties. It would be final nail in the ability of communities to seek responsibility from legislators.
I'll tell you Mr. Baird what it is time for. It is time to pursue a more balanced Middle East policy before you further endanger Canadians here and abroad.
More anti-American hate from Canada. Mickey Finn? Meathead?Like I said, if a Canadian hasn't spewed hate towards Americans in the past few minutes, just wait a bit. And right on cue. Canadians are hateful, evil, people.
No. I don't think sarcastic is what he was going for.
That's a very good point , if Wright created deception & Mr. Hamilton knew & said/ did nothing nor inform Mr. Harper... among others, well how does that square with Harpers 'Wright deceived me' quote.
The problem is that Albertans are addicted to not paying for services while demanding very good ones.
Interesting comment. Bring on the clowns!
Interesting how the article doesn't mention the countless millions of taxpayer's dollars in Conservative advertising disguised as government programs promotion.
Thanks for this observation. We have clarified the language in this article.
'Not acceptable to leftists these days. 'Speaking of thuggish and ugly. I can't tell you how sick I am of your slags against people of a different political persuasion than you. And BTW, I agree with Konrad too.
Equating satirical takedowns of Trump with Nazi dehumanization of Jews? Perhaps a wee bit over the top, don 't you think? Satire is much more polemic than humour - always has been, always will be.
Please explain the logic behind your comments. If this sort of drivel was presented to me by one of my grade 12 students, they'd fail because they present simplistic assertions with no reasoning or logic to back them up.
Great piece, Peggy!!!!!
The phrase 'approving XL is a no brainer' is prophetic. Now who was that that uttered the phrase? Some things stand the test of time.

39% majorities suggest 61% voted for someone else. Democracy is not about winners and losers. All citizens deserve representation.
Only 12% of Muslims voted Tory last time around so he's already lost them. Amongst the ethnic vote, it was mostly those from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as the Far East he gained.

More briefly: The Conservative Party has been successful duping supporters into giving them money based on a clearly paranoid and false delusion of persecution. They are, literally, crazy.

The only things Adams was right about was in sizing up Justin as a sucker for the pleading damsel-in-distress pitch. One hands out condoms, the other has no seat. That is just stupid.
The truth hurts, don't it, Barry?
canada voted for justin as he is burning canada down with his taxes, spending and stupidity
Rob Ford is far from perfect alright. He's drifting into the incompetent, way-over-his-head territory. But, on the bright side, his association with the prime minister has cost the Conservatives some support.
Could the problems not already be in his head?
Speaking of tools. It's arsenal.

The Sun got so tired of it's audience commenting that it just went ahead and removed them. And the Sun is pretty right wing... Those same people and their material are now flooding the G&M.
Back in the day, we also used to have public executions, beheadings, drawing and quartering, and prisons for the poor. This is a step backward to such times.

John Ibbitson is an opinion columnist, not a reporter. I'd expect someone who reads the Globe would understand the difference... thanks for proving me wrong :P

that applies to John Ibbotson too
To be honest, this editorial sounds like it was written by a Tea Party candidate, not the G&M editorial board.
You've never been to WEGZ on a weekend, have you?
Stalin promised a similar Freedom from Religion.
I think the use of the attached photo of M. Trudeau clearly shows the G&M's bias. The use of this illustration is an unpaid Conservative ad, as most people will see it and not read the article.
His promotion to the Federal Court by Harper shows what the Tories under Harper think of women. It's 2015, not 1815.

If the Cons got rid of Harper there is a reasonable chance they could get back in, with Harper Trudeau will have to really make some huge mistakes to lose the advantage he has.

You can say whatever you want about him but his statements on the Ontario Liberals cap and scam plan are dead on. They are stealing money from the small guy and thus far O Leary is the only one to stand up and point that out.
And Lawrence Martin said the exact opposite yesterday. That it was the right that was in trouble. I guess all traditional parties are in trouble then.

This electoral reform is nothing more than a 1st world problem. Like its really going to make your life better? In what way? Think about the issues the 3rd world faces every day and give your head a shake.
Steve Bannon has been described as anti sematic. Trumps daughter married a Jewish man and I believed converted herself. Should be fun.
Its true of much of Canadian media. Statism and lobby groups now run media. I was shocked to see Globe so blatantly push a Prentice propaganda piece. Pretty obvious Jim Prentice is a candidate supported by the crooked back room boys of Canada.
They never do.
I couldn't imagine selling my grandfather's watch (regardless of worth). It will be passed on to one of my children, with the explicit instructions that it is to be passed on to theirs. But to each his own.

Guess what Beijing Obama kow towed to you- Trump will be very different- the time of a bullying and militaristic China is coming to an end-along with its economy- Beijing is arrogant and has reaped what it has sown.
It does not matter what people are called. It is what they do that counts. The US has killed thousands of innocent people from South East Asia to the Middle East. Trump is a symbol of the US, financially wealthy and socially inept..
Trump may disappear from the media, but 45% of his followers live on to make a possible Clinton victory a real nightmare. Hillary will no longer be under Obama, and I can see a nervousbreakdown before the four year term and her 73rd birthday.
Good one Dixie... Come on Bemi, Dixie's being ironic
The eyewitness testimony and autopsy results seem to corroborate the policeman's version of events.
Do you agree with what Jackson had to say this summer (as opposed to your quote from 1993?)
Dougie and Lizzie would make up a fine oasis of progressive Canadian journalism stationed in China.
Typical. No response at all to the research. That is what you believe and nothing will change that ... right?
Is the CRA auditing Preston Manning's foundation?
you may be disappointed. but, are you the least bit surprised?
Are you saying my pension cap is too generous, detalumis? My own retirement plan is based on CPP/OAS/savings income of about $22k per year, but I thought suggesting a cap in that range would seem unreasonable to many G&M readers.
Actually what is said is that he's smarter and more in touch with Canadians than any of the policiticians running this country.
This is a joke, right?
Wisest comment on this entire thread Exferrious.
This particular speech was given on a day when the House was not sitting, so JT was not skipping out on his job.
So... still waiting to hear back from the Onion about your story ideas, huh? Well, never stop trying.
thank you for this article. Great to see some reality in the MSM.
I wonder how long they will stay together? It is like a match that , after a short time, has been made in hell!
That was kind of the point....
I would very much support an optional expansion.
Is the sky still blue? Horrors! I sort of agree with Ed Broadbent.
The 'local' stuff was better made.
Shame on Harper and Mulcair for using this weeks tragedy to pander for votes. Kudos to Justin Trudeau for showing leadership and vision.
Yes, ISIS is quaking in their boots. Dumbest article yet.
Because - this is very simple - if there was a spill an utterly irreplaceable and uniquely beautiful bit of our natural heritage would be contaminated for generations. Simply nothing at all is worth that risk - nothing.
Jack and Dart just proved your point. The kind of people who support the Dear Leader are not very intelligent.
No worries sunny days ahead

Looks like the noble public servants were busy commenting online today - during work hours. Business as usual in Ottawa.
@Canada1, A terrorist gunman burst into Parliament Hill. Are you the mind reader of the gunman that there's no assassination attempt? Is this a joking and a mocking matter for you?
Festis Bubble Pants signed in and made his first ever post under his new name at 8:30 tonight. Golly, wonder what name he was using before then.
Heaven forbid you begin a rational discussion with a perspective that discounts hysteria and emphasizes thought.
I didn't like Thatcher. But I think Michelle Obama has a good shot at 2020.
Bill, if you think there's too much of that, write the Globe and Mail.
How long were the Japanese in the concentration camp? 1939 -1945? 6 years. The first nations were traumatized for more than 6 years - the young were taken away and subject to horrific conditions lasting more than 6 years.
I take it you may not have agreed with Meg's closet bigotry?
The problem with 'meritocracy' is that it assumes that everyone has had a 'fair shot' at reaching their 'full potential'.
Unrealistic goals. No sense of fiscal responsibility. Not Yet Ready. Sadly the 39% are inflicting the pain on the 61% who did not vote Liberal.
When I was young and restless, my father told me he could solve all my problems, and then made out a cheque for a million dollars.
They have certainly capitalized on the southern white enmity toward the Democrats since the Civil Rights Act, haven't they ?
and why then should that one person be allowed to collect EI for an apprenticeship program and school purpose..... why not work and pay their own way??
hehe ... yeah, and teach it schools alongside that unproven trope about evolution
I call BS - a Senator can bill Canadians their living expenses for every single day they are in Ottawa doing Senate business. Why on earth would any of them live in motorhomes there unless they wanted to?
Most of these guys can't begin a thought without bashing liberals somehow.
Nonsensical verbage
My, you must long for the days of Quotas and Restricted Clubs and Orange Day Parades and Men Only taverns.
You make me puke. Is the fact that Canada is built on it's environmental resources lost on you?
And while we're at it, let's move everyone from rural Canada to big cities too?
Indeed Bud, perhaps we should just preemptively wrap the heads of Harperite candidates in duct tape.
Which incompetent and corrupt party would you prefer?
Oh that is so rich of an anti-pipeline activist now "supporting" pipelines just to maintain accidental power...
It was never the Wheat Board's responsibility to manage the grain car fleet. That issue needs to be blamed on the railways and weather.
...Based on the track record, probably with personal attacks on the author. Sad, really.
Hi Earl. Did you take your meds today?
Why? Because we are tired of being labelled as lumberjacks in popular culture, that's why.
Nobody is buying your Russian nonsense...
'When can we expect the Globe and Mail to stop shilling for Trudeau?'You seem to forget that the Globe and Mail endorsed Harpo in the last two elections.
What happens when the future meets the benighted past.
Trump swings wildly to pick up bigots of all stripes - and almost always in coded language. Consider his initial lukewarm approach to KKK support.
Most sensible post of the bunch....unfortunately that'll make it hard on Clinton's starry-eyed, drooling supporters.

Your analogy is not relevant since there is no evidence that the male MP's engaged in sexual misconduct, other than' she told him that she told me.' Not very compelling.
McCain has been an opportunist and has pandered to the lunatic right-wing when he thought it would gain him traction in his Presidential bid.

Tories have an edge in the media? Wake up and read. And you make senior citizens sound like devils.
Paying taxes on property does not make you a resident.
Carolyn Bennett's outburst is a pretty good indication of what the government doesn't want to hear. So much for open and transparent government.
Remember Obama's election pledge on transparency to post legislation for five days, CPAN? and be the most transparent government? How is the transparency working out now?
I have to see it to believe it.
Neither the liberals nor the NDP ever said they would 'completely change our democratic system WITHOUT A REFERENDUM.' If you have a point to make, do so without inventing things to put in other peoples mouths.
Do you realize how silly you sound? You've taken a stance 180 degrees opposite of a 'Conservative'.
We need real changes. A few ideas - people on the reserves need to be given the title to the their houses and incentivize people in remote reserves to move to the bigger population centres that have more services and opportunity for their children.

Alberta was Canada's first jurisdiction to put a price on Carbon in 2008. This move only deepens our commitment. Ontario, where most of the whining comes from, still has no legislation in place.
If they join the US the problem is quickly solved, and Canada really will have to sell resourcefulness. Does that come in aerosol?

Why? It happens every time a Trudeau is PM....
So then why do you continually post on this site? Perhaps you would be better off posting on a site where opinion is more palatable and in keeping with your view of how the world should be.
crypto-fascist, corporatist.....
Stewart consistently failed to demonstrate balanced handling of 'faith based' or 'we create our own reality' alternative views. Time to pull the plug on the Daily Show. -)

At least Harper has delivered on 'transparency'. Most Canadians see right through him.
Chief Saunders explained his position on carding in a Globe and Mail article a few weeks ago and referred to knowing who was 'in the zoo'. He says it works and has helped solve several murders. I'll take him at his word. He doesn't pull his punches.
Piffle. Trump has a cozy relationship with Putin, while Obama has put tough sanctions on Russia and sent troops to Eastern Europe.
Sounds like a plan.
Wait until election reform is completed. The Tea Party of the North will be relegated to the political wilderness, permanently.
fear has won the day in Britain========Democracy wins, it is people's power. Suck it up.
Mulroney should have know that there is no such thing as a real conservative Quebecker.
Well, since Ford himself can't supply you with a reason to vote for him you'd might as well take what's available eh?
The police are contracted out at a premium fee
Somebody has to respond to the tar sands crusaders.
Ho hum! The sheeple of this province will fall back asleep as we let this fester . Meanwhile , the foreigners will continue to grease the political parties coffers ensuring their monopoly at the expense of the local micros !
He is leading us to prosperity. Get used to it.
Comparing someone to Trump ,like its a bad thing. Globe and mail is home to so much entitled cucks.
Not bad advice, Jetson. Maybe we should stay away from the US.It might work for you, too - since you think Canadians are pathologically hateful, maybe you should stop reading Canadian online newspapers. Just a thought.
Too many don't ever want a 'post racial' society. They prefer to define differences by race rather than behaviour.
Privatize, privatize, privatize... all of them... teachers, cops, garbage collectors, nurses.. all of them.
LOL, quoting Maclean's, the bible of Canadian corporate drivel. I'm sure it will be a crisis when the 'New Economy' does away with Mag's trite scribblings.
So, women in the military should be tough and just ignore rampant sexism while the poor hetro men are excused if they get the vapours over having to shower with gay men.
Its because of garbage like this that I would never pay to read the G&M and its stable of climate science deniers
Three years, oh wow.
Utter tosh.
Complete rubbish. Canadian citizens living abroad are not required to pay taxes in Canada.
Why should they? Even Israel, the home of all Jews, is starting to make noises about some of them 'not deserving' to be there. Netanyahu should try to remember what his grandma told him about how 'welcomed', Jewish refugees were in the 30's.
The system doesn't work in this caseThe socialists are forming a government comprised of yoga instructors , baristas , nursery school teachers and 20 year old college students whilst the majority of the province voted for right of center candidates
We're just grumpy because we didn't put away $12000 a month in RRSP's like you did.
Apparently, that's "Doctor" Troll. BWWWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! (Goodness, I can hardly contain myself)
I am concerned with our government's sense of entitlement to make and break treaties after the fact. Contracts were broken and some misrepresented... by us.
Most are aware but you're right, it's an unimportant sidebar to much bigger issues that need to be addressed.
We need to write the regulations - like we need better regulations on government reimbursement of moving expenses. We need better information - like we need better information on foreign purchases of Canadian real estate.
No one said accommodating religious views is an absolute. Such accommodation needs to consider safety, work obligations, effect on others, etc... Your argument is a red haring.
Could be that when you've been lecturing the population (those bigots and racists) and bragging to the tourists about diverse immigration, you don't want to highlight any problems.
'Ottawa's stand hasn't won us any friends ... because everyone knows we don't really mean it.'Does the current government say anything that it really means?
You're being pedantic. You know damned well that by post-carbon, he means post-carbon emissions.
Big deal - as if Wildrose voters would every vote Liberal. Who cares.
The fact that many communities in poorer countries tend to get by, and the people seem content, does not mean they don't want the same things we do. And don't think they wouldn't trade places in a heartbeat.
Propaganda from the Harper gang war room.
I would happy see him at the end of a rope, in his spare time he was making bombs to use against Canadian forces, you do remember those pictures of him ? Want to tell that to some of our dead troops
Re read Uncle Tom's Cabin too Uncle.. I'll spell it out to you.. Many of the hateful comments are just that hateful.. They often bring about a knee jerk response.. like yours just did.. so thanks for illustrating the point..
and I am glad to have left Canada for the USAenjoy the rip-off
Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Phillipines, Samoa, Fiji, (I'll assume we exclude New Zealand and Australia as colonies) Thailand, Malaysia, Nepal, Turkey, Egypt, ...
You mean just like they did in 1940 when they stood alone against Nazi Germany and could have sued for peace and like they did when the Falklands were invaded by Argentina. What a dope!
And this coming from a 'journalist' - too funny!
so...60% did not vote for Harper... it does not necessarily mean they voted against him... maybe they just liked someone else better

Much like Maimonides, who believed that the Messiah would come but "...he may tarry."
And the 20-something author of the book? Is she just trying to 'get the old folks riled up about young people' too? Or are you just being stupidly simplistic?
taxes do not pay Super Marg's salary, that's the entire point. if she doesnt produce, she's history. firefighters do nothing and get paid huge from the taxpayer's pocket
Sorry I meant "food shortage" (possible pun was not intended, lol).
Odd. Making jokes and even statues ridiculing Trumps supposedly tiny dick and big belly was considered a perfectly valid political statement.
Except Junior isn't egalitarian, he is a truthiness follower....he is far more interested in how things look rather than how they are.
Totally off-base because it's absolutely clear that Justin is a chip off the old Pierre with nothing at all genetic in him reminiscent of Mick Jagger. Dosibe's comment is mildly amusing but dead wrong!
The Afghani is the currency of Afghanistan. An Afghan is a person from Afghanistan.
The Boy Blunder does it again, but hey the hair!
I don't believe you know what you are talking about. You just don't.
I voted Liberal, although it stuck in my craw to do so. Now I'm saying 'Impress me!'
Is this about Canada or the Conservative party? Perhaps some real generosity of spirit might make this noteworthy.
Dude... awesome.
equal? worthy? What planet do you live on?
Poilievre is scribbling propaganda at the Grope & Flail because it improves his chances of a prosperous retirement in the Senate.
Especially when he is obviously incapable of accepting any personal responsibility - except when smearing all others equally and unfairly. He must be the king of, 'but mommy, tommy did it too!'.
As she ever was. You nailed it.
It all makes one think they should check Pitcairn's Island, just in case ...

Feel free to move to the failed state of your choice.
Guess who else wears balaclavas? Canadians on a cold day. What a ridiculous argument.
"This time there is no self-proclaimed heir to the throne trying to get Harper's job." And that is the way Harper likes it...
Send them back before they take you down.
Singling out Russia is an obviously political act designed to improve prospects for the countries selected to remain. The Olypmics is a sick joke.
You're griping in a way that's unfair. We ought to mollycoddle natives because we owe it to them. Read your Canadian history.
Fake issue with even worse 'solution'
Yes, jack, your reputation for servicing the PM is without question.
We cut corporate taxes here in Canada down to 15% and every sound of mind economist will tell you it had zero effect on economic growth or job growth.
How much in the decline of fuel is due to the overall economic slow down that has occurred between 2005 and 2015?
Kevin will be the topic at all the press/liberal cocktail parties. Get ready for accountability girls and boys.
So. tired. of. Wente.
This will not stand a Charter challenge.
Mulroney's legacy whether you like him or not 1. North American Free Trade 2. GST if they are bad we had about 20 years to get rid of them so they must be good or we are lazy and incompetent grudgingly admit Mulroney left a legacy CHRETIEN left none
Holland was pretty dumb.
I don't recall Trudeau saying any such thing in this article. Dion does.
the fiscally conservative option is never out to lunch fiscal conservative = fiscal responsibility = fiscal management and Horwath of NDP has been converted
Pedal to the metal mostly brings fines by the enforcers, hence the Brussel bureaucrats...
What would Jon Stewart do with the likes of Pierre Poilievre night after night?
Trump lacks the self-awareness to see that he is destroying his chances. Perhaps his never ending goal of pleasing his father has taken him to the extreme.
The Alberta numbers are approximately $2 billion per year at $30/tonne. That's just Alberta. Extrapolate to Canada at $30/tonne and you're looking at about $15 billion. Go to $50/tonne and you're at $25 billion.
Good point PHILCO3 umm except that uhh yeah... They re-opened the criminal investigation on Friday Oct. 28th per a letter from Comey to Congress.
no i beleive his vision is to boost america and to make it great again
They shouldn’t just be taking away your rights, they should be gassing you
Wrong, wrong wrong and wrong again. Trump will be the first three term President since Roosevelt.
There is only one group that the government is trying to discourage - extreme Islam as represented by the full burhka. They need to call a spade a spade.
You are not thinking like a good global citizen. You must be from that left wing nationalist wing of the PQ which imagined that people owned a country's resources.
Please extend that analysis to all religious extremists, regardless of faith. We have suffered far more cases of religious extremism in Canada/USA carried out by non-Islamists than by Muslims over the past 30 years. No excuses for any of them.
Laachraoui was born in Morroco. Do you deny that?
No wonder the UK was glad to see them go
Define real job. You lefties always portrayed that. So in terms of real job. How is a part time drama teacher any better than being a mail room clerk?
If sane minds rule the day, then we start work on the DRL. But, this is Toronto, so I'm sure we'll argue about that for a decade or so.
Actually, the first step would be to elect someone who will implement your rules.
I think some of the posters here should resolve to be as perfect as they expect Ms. Wente to be.Maybe if she wrote some articles about the 'Shiny Pony's' hair she would be better received by some of you. She is a good writer. Enjoy.
I kind of agree with you. If you look at Facebook for example, it is always changing its privacy policies and when you sign up you ratify its ability to change it polices without client consultation.
The 2016 election has little to do with traditional party lines. Democrats will vote Republican and visa versa. The outcome is unpredictable.
Like Harper didn't
In other words, Trudeau and his team are not qualified and cannot be trusted to spend the money. Trudeau will bring the Ontario Green Energy fiasco to all of Canada.
Ha ha. All the lefties frothing at the mouth at the mere suggestion that Christy might get elected again.
WedgyIt is Exactly what Gardiner has stated! Why the Social Engineering, when it does NOT prove to help the Kids whatsoever! Typical Socialist Garbage, to add MORE to a Bloated Payroll, without a thought on how to implement it properly!
divorce rate is about 33% in Canada and 50% n the US, last time I checked
Maybe there's a movie there... "Naughty Hill"?
Refused? His family did not even ask to come to Canada.
That may be true in Ontario.
What Nixon called junior's daddy applies to junior as well.
hope Merkel leaves the door a little open so that Justin can sneak out with her
'root causes' unfortunately, has become code-speak for anti-American.
Come on. Its a Seinfeld columnist. You know - stories about nothing. They've got lots of em

The 'vision' thing was a management fad some years ago ! Please spare us all from such tripe.
The anti - GMO crowd are the same types who are anti - nuclear !Don't let facts interfere with your anti - whatever religion.
Why doesn't the Globe run an in-depth investigation into which firms are creating these ads, and if they're using taxpayer money to do it?
The conservatives are just as bad or worse. See Merkel, Cameron and Turnbull for starters. They make a loud noise for political gain but in the end they are on the same team as their supposed opponents.
A more accurate statement is many Democrats who voted for Obama both times stayed home thus allowing the racists to win.
Tosh Show us the peer reviewed study to support your assertion.
Which will never happen if they manage to slither their way back into office.
Yeah, but MS never really caught on. I don't even remember the last time I heard someone use it, or saw it used in correspondence. The school boards have come up with something so bizarre, that it's unlikely the general public will adopt it.
Good. If he's going to do the job he's been elected to, there's an element of a-hole necessary to deal with reform, and apparently, the NDP. Suck it up, Princess.
Under the new bill, Peter McKay as Attorney General would become responsible for investigating election frauds. Read section 509(1).
Saudi Arabia is the master mind behind the global Jihadism and have created a seperate version of Islam called Wahhabis that are hell bent on destroying anything good for their own benefit. No wonder Harper and his cloonies support them!
Give it a break Stiv, this is just spam.
Hear Hear.
Harper, the manipulator that he is, is using the lone wolf shooting to further his fear agenda... if you cannot see this-you are blind
My grandfathers were POWs in WW2. The one that is still alive loves it. Not sure how this is a fascist monstrosity. Please explain.
nothing to do with paying taxes (most 18 year olds don't) but Sutherland has a home here and obviously pays taxes on it.
Trudeau and millennials have zero inclination to fight for anything, let's just acknowledge that, give up the charade, disband the military, and enjoy the sunny days.
I'm a 1000% in favor of speaking ill of the dead. I'll cut Ralph a little slack though ... not much, just enough to acknowledge his fallibility.
And who is Mr. Gibson when he's at home? Why, a hired hand at the Fraser Institute! A tick for me - I guessed that before looking him up. And why wouldn't the G&M indicate such at the end of the article?
I wouldn't be so sure. Considering how low in the polls the Liberals were two years ago they might have taken a chance on Justin anyway even without the power of his name.
I think you could say the same for Liberals and Catholics.
That he is a gentleman or not hardly matters. What matters is how civilized the rest of us are. If you find acceptable the way he is treated, you are at least as bad as he was - and since you would be doing it in cold blood, probably worse.
Sure it is political game playing. JT had better get up to speed or he is going to lose.
IMO, it is pretty much a repeat of what happened in Kiev except executed 100 times better.
and Mulroney ... and Harper, but it took successive liberal gvts to restore sanity in our finances 7 yrs of surpluses in a row, get it ?
No one has brought a complaint based on the general ban on sexual relations between unmarried couples. Because that is something that has been effectively circumvented for all of human history.
You're so far off the mark, it would be funny if you weren't serious. The G&M supported Harper in the last two elections. Pretending that they are Liberal shills shows YOUR prejudices, not theirs.
Can someone tell me the advantage the Liberals gain by welcoming her? A petulant, spoiled 1st term MP no longer wanted by her party hardly seems like a boon to me.
Uhm How long ago was Regan the President??? Oh wait you still gush over Trudeau I know!
Calgarian - Agreed. I would have loved to have been in the Post lunchroom today to see Coyne and Iverson square off on their respective viewpoints.
Yes, lets put the fox into the henhouse. Of all the people you could possibly put into that position, Dean del Mastro is probably number 32,999,999 on the list.
You mean 'The Sociopathic Business Party'.But religion is just one of their crowd control techniques.
It's fascinating how much more Canadians likes to write, talk, rant, bash about Quebec secession, the PQ and QC in general than Quebeckers themselves. It must be therapeutic in some ways!
This is satire piece right?
It's time that both Olympics have permanent venues. Summer on an island in the Aegean. Winter, at an Austrian resort.
I'll wager that if Harper is tossed nothing will change in the governance of Canada.
What a pile of nonsense.
Next let's move on to the House of Commons. I'm sure there's a few dirty MPs would deserve suspensions too. Let's start with Quebec seats -- we know there's corrupt problems in that province -- cull them, especially the NDP.
rmillier the coward of the day clearly wouldnt fight for anything but his latest hand out
Hello GloARc, I tried the link twice and got this: 404 NOT FOUNDSorry, the page you're looking for does not exist. Please try a site search
Kiss of defeat.
Sounds like PORTER got the job and you lost out ??????
First, ask Harper to fire Jenni Byrne. Next all his paid 'communications specialists'What do you think about that Mr. C.? How would that effect you?
Congratulations to Paul Heinbeker for telling it like it is. It is time for forelock-tugging monarchists to grow up. Canada needs a head of state selected here, not the offspring of a British royal family with a very checkered history.
Ummmm..........ummm.....dictionary not your friend?
Hmm... and yet when, after 4 years in office, the American voter had the chance to turf him out, they did... what? They preferred him over the Republican candidate.
Agreed. The last thing we need is a 'pizza parliment' where it takes a collation of 4 or 5 parties to form a government. These governments generally make few long term changes since they are highly unstable and collapse very easily.
Chalk and cheese.
Does that mean that his is your last post?
Be thankful this isn't in the states... Some bleeding heart liberal would be screaming the anti-bullying law infringes on the freedom of speech
'Moral compass?'Such amusing understatement from sugarplum fairy land. Don't make light of the habitual behaviour of a gang of corrupt fascists trashing Canada.
at one point people came to fox to tell all the creators ,writers, producers of the Simpsons that what they where doing is wrong and that the show should be banned and shut down because it is imoral. If you cannot see irony in it then that's on you
His point was that the Swissair crash taught us something. MH370 may have a similar lesson.
'One thing it should be noticed is that Obama's presidency deteriorated American's racial relationship significantly.'Utter nonsense.
and we will wait in joyful expectation for the coming of another saviour from the west - one who will blacken our name and our skies.
Davey, How about your favs, Bev Oda... or maybe RocksAnne James?
What shall they replaced with? Support the PM articles, regardless of what he does?
Some people are just slower than others
I would like to see the law that allowed your people to invade and kill Palestinians. The bible/torah is NOT a land deed, nobody had a right to hand your people that land.
'Not much of a prize' - and yet more Canadians voted for Justin as party leader than voted for Harper as party leader or Muclair as party leader.
Generally correct, Margaret. Hence, all the more reason to vote for Harper and the Conservatives. Pragmatic, steady as she goes during an economically unstable period.
Lotza men personalizing it. Why call her out?
'Opposite Day at the Supreme Court'That line had me falling down laughing!
I can't remember it was at least five years ago. But it was a decent website for media studies people.
We should not encourage any trade with China. They have turned their country into a gigantic cesspit where the air and water are actively dangerous. Now that attitude is being exported around the world.
PM Gerald Butts runs the country. A hater of oil and western Canada.
DB-TA. You said: "About one-third of doctors are known by Big Pharma to be influenced by payola, and another third who they know will use them to get free samples." 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 I didn't misquote you.
Definitely Freddie, I have no idea why we allow career criminals to exist. In your 30's and your only job has been drug dealing? Off you go, you are of no benefit to society. It's big business for the government so they allow it to continue.
Everyone would love a 4-day work week. Very, very few are willing to accept four days pay for it.
He attempted to subvert out parliamentary system with his shameless abuse of its traditions and its weaknesses. A leader you could trust??
While everyone should be free from harassment I am worried this simply makes those kids who are different stand out even more making them bigger targets.
Ibbitson and nearly ALL his colleagues were wrong about the election. But anyone expecting them to eat crow will be disappointed! They just move on to another topic where they can lambaste someone who doesn't share their opinions.
He could do worse than appoint Jim Stanford. LOL
You make some very good points. One has to wonder why the Hydro Quebec option was not taken, especially when you consider what we got, the disastrous Green Energy Act.
Is an Africentric school a move forward?
Does the average person really see multiculturalism as anything but a variety of different restaurants serving foods from around the world?
First and foremost - the act of preparing for war, or a show of force as a deterrent to war, or strategic military alliances - is about money. You can wrap it up with any type of bow you want, but always come down to who gets paid the most.
Especially the United Way and it's member agencies!
You forgot to include "hysterical" and "prattle" in you comments. No bonus for you. Jenni
' its ability to write its own laws, set its own borders, etc' Do tell us when the EEC/ EC/ EU changed the UK's borders? Oh right , they didn't.Kinda like the UK parliament passing its own laws left right and centre.
Bravo a woman that understands the value men bring to the table.
Feminism has a stronger chin than most men.
You prefer twitter-feed Gazebo Tony?!
What Wente fails to grasp is pretty much everything.
The author overlooks the fact that the roots of the Vietnam war were planted during the Kennedy administration and LBJ grew it into a full blown conflict which Nixon ended.
Twiglets, Pride goeth before a fall. Look out belooooooooooooowwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, crap. I tried to save you. But you were too proud.
3 unintelligent & arrogant replies to date. I tried watching one. It was painful.
They ought to be careful, I'm guessing that in a world of out-muscling it won't be university folks who end up on top.
Perhaps, but is that a reason to let matters worsen?
How did he get the job with Iron Ore Canada? He's a crook.
What a waste of my country. And the useful idiots keep on giving in to it.
That is a legitimate concern. Is there some way to construct the fund to make this extremely difficult?
mont. I believe that she is a Canadian citizen.
Section 2 of the Charter allows freedom of speech, so your request is a moot point.
But MOOCs as currently configured pretty clearly aren't the future. Most universities that invested heavily in them in the first flush of enthusiasm have retrenched. At this point, the completion rates are incredibly low.

Pst....Public Servants are the backbone of the Canadian Government... and we are the 11 th riches Country in the world...
He deserved to be fired for harassment in the workplace. That it was her workplace, rather than his, is immaterial.
You are absolutely right. The media are simply not providing a straight story about the mess that the career politicians have made in the States.
Yet another egghead pontificating from her ivory tower.

There will be civil war, too many people don't want to go along with this 3rd world genocide, there will be a war to separate and form normal nations like we used to be, not these 3rd world cesspools that are being forced on us now.

oops my bad, Little Boy and Fat Man.
Without stating it explicitly Ibbitson regards Trump, correctly, as a demagogue who will say and do anything to achieve power. His whole campaign has been fraudulent.
You don't need to shout
This is Homer's job. He actually gets paid towrite anti-Conservative, pro LPC propanganda.
Ford has reduced spending. There've been concessions in labour contracts. The size of government has been reduced through attrition. Credit where credit is due.
Yes, we're much more left-wing here in Canada, which is why the Harpies are such a bad fit.
Trump will be the greatest American President ever.
Liberal in name only if you're including Clark. The BC Liberal party is not Liberal, they are the Conservative party of BC and have been for the last 15 years or so.
You acknowledge that the Canada you love has given you much. So stay and fight for that Canada. Use your education and erudition to effect change. Perhaps your note above can be a new beginning.
Everybody agrees we should screen immigrants, and we do.The argument is about whether Leitch's proposal would make our screening system better or whether it would just be a waste of time and money.
In the meantime, the Globe has maintained 'Wright kept Harper in the dark about repaying Duffy, trial hears' as the prime headline for the entire day even though the validity of that statement has been shredded in the court.
@dianeWell, we have to - once again - congratulate the G&M for some tasty click-bait. I know I'm hooked. Next up will be a think-piece about how those media ghouls should get off Rob Ford's back.
Really? What happened to this 'silent majority' in the last election? Maybe you should become a pollster and be wrong like all the rest of them.

Not true, you see these panels stuck into the corner of corn fields everywhere.
Please explain what parts of my comments above are 'Zionist myth', providing verifiable evidence to support your claims.
The reason it needs to be short is because there is no question who's got the bigger guns. Without balance, there is no peace except for an oppressive peace. We, the public, must serve as that balance.

Oh what nonsense. Orthodox Jews do not impose their laws on anyone. They are most certainly not trying to create a Jewish version of Shariah to rule the world.

The story has been an issue in the fringe media for some time but it takes a credible MSM journalist to explain the problem in simple terms.
Yep, that's what you'd expect from the Justin fan club. We don't need a Charter or constitutional protections anymore because Justin's a nice guy! Plus now we can crack down on the 'religious right' and take away their rights!
How many divisions does he have?
I do not think I can ever remember such an intelligent string of commentary as I have read here for this article. What a delight. There is intelligent life in the universe after all!
I knew that this subject would be red meat for all the trolls out there...
Voting reform. Everyone claims to want it, until they're actually in a position to do something about it. Then the status quo that got them there suddenly looks like the best solution.

This editorial is a joke, right? What a ridiculous premise. I think all honourable Americans should turn their backs whenever trump appears in public, and boycott any event he hosts.
The nannies and the chef are not her personal staff.
Excellent information. Thank you.
Thank you. Your research is appreciated.
I don't know that I'd call them 'thoughts'. More, word like noises resulting from the random firing of neurons in a barley functioning brain.
rick, he specifically calls the production of the panels high GHG. That is the point I'm making, I'm not arguing about the merits or the rest of his argument just providing context to one statement the author made that was mis leading.
May be getting careless here, but Harper might have been relieved he was still alive, thinking it was an assassination attempt on him. How else to explain emotion from such a wax figure?
No kidding!
It is a sad article. Ugly.
So you know her better than she does???
Sheep is another example of the Fox News Effect ... the only people who know less about current events that Fox News viewers are people who don't watch news at all. Look it up!
Canada, to my knowledge, has not enshrined individual property rights per se. That is more of an American thing. The land is forever, its owners are not. Americans have it wrong.
Trump supporters are the sorest winners around. This is what happens when you are the President elect and President. All your actions are held to account on a daily basis.
Pravda is staffed by professionals too.
Excellent article, Amira. Ignore the bigots and xenophobics. What's appalling is when our Senate and our PM exploit the dim xenophobes for their votes just like other demagogues in history.
Nonsense... absolute nonsense. Read the curriculum. I have
Doug is a typical SJW defending his cultural marxist agenda by calling anyone against it racists.

Good one, G&M. And then there's that six months mandatory jail time for possessing six pot plants . . . . Oh wait a minute.
Party politics is about bias, I might equally conclude that you are biased against Prof Mintzberg. Bias is in the eye of the beholder.
Work Farce, you didn't "invent multiculturalism", and you haven't been paying attention if you think wearing an Indian shirt means your personal experience trumps an actual study.
I definitely think that Trump would be a disaster to the whole world, but I highly doubt he would try to invade Canada. That's stretching it a little.
Cork is just comfortably eliding the issues around using someone's creative output without paying, which is the reason why artists aren't paid well enough....

i judge Ford by the admissions he has clearly made. I do not want the mayor of my city smoking crack cocaine and getting embarrisingly drunk and wondering around the city. You are merely an apologist for Mr. Ford.
Blah blah blah. Harper's Reichspropaganda organ arguing with itself.
Your faith in Wikipedia is almost as unfounded as the faith others have in a Supreme Being.
Judy - you are Australian? Were you concerned with Australians killing Muslims in Afghanistan?
Gordon why doesn't Mr. Harper rewrite the Constitution? He can change the role of the Supreme Court of Canada to what ever he wants it to be or he can completely eliminate it. That is the correct solution to our current problem.
YES!!! The citizens who left are far more important than the ones contributing to society.
As Justin said about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia, one cannot interfere with the sanctity of a government contract.
It's either OK for all three of Harper, Justin, and Stephane Dion use this term or it isn't.Liberals and their media cheerleaders beclown themselves when they start trying to parse and hairsplit.
Wow. You have entirely missed the purpose of this article. We have a fundamental choice here. And it is one based on obvious aggression and intent to harm an ally. It is not a vague intelligence source or opinion.
Let them fight - and may the 'best man' win!

It looks like Ontario voters are unhappy with all three parties. It is going to be very difficult to choose the next government.

It's all part of the master plan to move the capital to Vancouver.
I think you make too light of both the Republican mood and the Trump mood. When US Senators say they will not proceed with Presidential picks for the Supreme Court that country in is for some very difficult and dislocating times.
I agree, but (1) there can still be debate about what is acceptable for those places and (2) the justification for girl's dress codes is the real issue of this article and it's often very sexist.
The press is trying to jump on every major and minor misstep Trump makes but many admire his politics. He has a very good chance of becoming the next president even though many, especially the establishment, do not like the idea.
In that case, they are becoming far more efficient and deadly! What world do you live in an where do you get your statistics?
The irresponsible media has 'no interest in unifying America'.What would the left do without the class wars, gender wars, race wars that they love to keep the fools voting for 'progress' as the left see fit.

There's no money in doctors without borders either. Whatever they do get is nothing compared to what they would earn in private practice.
It's this type of regional and divisive politics that liberals have become known for.
it's not a 'story'...it's light commentary.
This has been addressed - see CanoeDave's post. Also: 1. How is "3rd party advertising" defined? 1. Who's been tasked with enforcing the new rules? I bet no-one. 2. What are the penalties if you do anyway? Jail time? I doubt it.
It's called faith or believe for a reason. Logic is an attempt to either confirm or debunk ones faith or believe. To believe does not require logic.
I can't believe you bothered to comment on this.
Do actually know neo-liberal means? If you were told that the Scandanavian democracies are increasingly 'neo-liberal' would you understand what is being said?
What a deplorable comment.
Ask the dinosaurs what caused the ice age. I think that was this so called climate change. It's called cycles of weather people. But we have to,put a label on it so the so called climate change experts can benefit.

Wow, the writer is very kind and careful with his words describing the Trudeau's fantasy world created for canadian mass consumption. Maybe the writer is a liberal himself
Another juvenile and witless comment from the site troll, wearing his ignorance as a badge of honour.
I'm waiting for Trump to follow through on his boast that he can shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose support.
That's what it is about. But the Dems are too stupid to see this and adjust their attitude. Live and learn.
I suppose you support the idea of Canadians voting in a sweater-wearing crooner who hides in closets?
Refute the argument if you don't agree. To simply claim 'bias' is intellectually lazy.
Even convicted felon Conrad Black said: 'If I was accused of being a cocaine user and I wasn't, I wouldn't pretend that the issue wasn't out there.'Black added: 'He's like the embarrassing guest at a family Christmas party.'
The NDP did nothing that has not been done hundreds of times before. Those who should really be ashamed are the people who voted to put in place a PM who is not qualified for the office.
Are you old enough to know what ADSCAM was or vote for that matter?
It's not about the G&M. It's about the Liberal government trying to have it both ways. If yo u talk the talk you should walk the walk.

Using the word 'principles' in connection to Harper and his CRAP (Corrupt Reform Alliance Party) Government is an oxymoron.
NYT does not have full-time coverage of Canada. So it is missing a small detail, in writing what was probably a human-interest story to counter the poisoned Skittles narrative of Donald Trump Jr.'s stand against refugees.

Ya - as soon as I read that it was clear Saunder's piece was imperial propaganda.
'Mr. Trudeau started this'? What? 12 million Canadians have smoked pot. Isn't it time our laws reflected this? Gangs shouldn't run the pot business. Neither should the government. Let people grow their own.

The latest chapter in the Globe's never-ending hatchet job on Harper. Wonder what comparisons are coming next? Hitler? Stalin?
What an ill informed comment. You have a river flowing by at the rate of 2000 m3 per second. Why would you need a dam to store water? There is an abundance flowing by every second.
You are doing a remarkable job teaching the truth of the history. My salute to your courage!
Isn't a myth for me.
Right. Our Liberal government will leave no-one unapologized-to, except maybe us old straight white guys.
Did Wright break a law? Did Harper know about it, did ?Harper approve of it and did Harper lie to the public and to Parliament?
I always wonder what I would do if I had a male boss who I knew had these religious beliefs. I don't know how I would trust him to not follow his religious beliefs with respect to how he viewed me.

Provable facts. It is that simple.
Ironically, your post should make perfect sense to those who agree with Dr. Grayson.
' ... now that we know CO2 emissions have nothing to do with global warming ...'lol! Obviously, you're a disciple of that famous denial 'expert' (and believer in creationism rather than evolution) Roy Spencer. Go back to Faux News.
Actually, Brazilians (and Canadians) have lots to fear if the Canadian government thinks spying for private gain is part of its mandate.
Did your son think to tell university officials or police? Would you mind sharing the name of the university with us?
You seem to post the same stuff every day.
No they aren't.The PCs are serious about privatizing and selling off public assets to their crony capitalist friends, like Mike Harris did. Note that Harris is an extremely wealthy man now, serving on multiple corporate boards.
No, we demand the PM do the business. The spouse should not travel to every event., we do not have the presidential system.
Where Canadians were involved, Canadians should be prosecuted.

You obviously don't understand the use of statistics in planning for ll levels of government. We get it.Math is hard.
Absolutely. Trudeau' actions used to qualify as treason. Image if some politician took money from a businessman connected to the Russian government?
We all deserve better than your inane and trite comment!
Elke, Prentice did 'butt' out, and went on to private ambitions, which he has done vastly better at. The no brainer is the one who thinks that the NDP or Liberals will actually achieve anything during their mandate.

LOL thanks for confirming that muttering on a bus is rational. Seriously though, i appreciate this column. This is not an easy topic, but it's critical that we talk about it if we value democracy.
True. But the reason that climate change is a problem is that fossil fuel usage ALSO adds to production costs. In the long run.
To be healthy = Eat little to no processed food, never drink any pop or sugary drinks.. try to limit sugar and salt. Get some exercise anything is better than nothing. Its that simple. Being health is also NOT a goal its a lifestyle.
I quite agree with your comments. Trudeau made too many Cabinet appointments solely for political reasons. Dion, the Justice Minister and the Minister for Democratic Reform are prime examples where competence Lost out of to image.
what a contradiction
Its just ignorant to suggest Harper is an intellectual lightweight. Call him a cheater, a lier, bully as you wish, but there is no evidence to suggest he isn't relatively smart man. Trudeau on the other hand......the evidence just keeps piling up.

detalumis - one difference is alot of men don't find career oriented women attractive but women don't seem to have this same aversion. Or if they do they don't voice it very loudly.
Why just the internet? Because that's what Harper's domestic spying bills says is important?
So the G&M editorial board didn't know what they were getting when they endorsed Harper in the last election even though Canadians have already seen years of his Cons contempt for Canadian who are not part of their narrow minded base.
You appear to be emotionally unstable.
by 'elitist' you mean objective fact based journalism? As opposed to making the facts fit the opinion? You want the media to take climate change Denial seriously? To present stories on why women want too much? On why we have too many immigrants?

if you accept the polls - and that's a dodgy prospect at best - the conservatives will lose far more in the toronto/gta area than they could ever expect to gain in quebec.
over at the CBC video site. He says they won't.
The stereotyping doesn't help anything.
Why is the Globe and Mail not posting my comments, the truth hurts
Only lefty Libs like you that I see trying to suppress free speech.
Why do these politicians in Canada keep searching for money pits to toss taxpayers money into? Does anybody know of a way to reprogram these dolts?
I for one am embarrassed with Harper as 'Prime Minister' of Canada. What kind of person locks themselves in the bathroom and cries when visiting a foreign country? That is exactly what Harper did in Brazil. What a creep.
Hudak tried to gut unions and look what happened to him.
Why not raise the carbon tax so high that none of us will be able to drive or heat our homes. Let's bring our economy to a complete hault!
Then foolish, short-sighted me will continue to purchase cheese and chickens only across the line in Washington State.
Very good posts, Science Boy.
Harper must make it absolutely clear to all Canadians when he meets with the FN leaders that aboriginal sovereignty is not now and never will be negotiated.
Islam is not a problem! Please deal with the real issues. That applies to you too G&M.
"financial resources." Making up imaginary terms to draw imaginary parallels. Too funny! You are aware that there are finite natural resources but finances are infinitely growing, yes? Or do you not understand what inflation is?
Love your grown-up, partisan-based emotional outburst! It has really helped move this comment board's mature, fact-based discussion forward. Take care.
Oh, I see. It was a case of 'best of a bad bunch.' Good to know that, ubatuba.
Ridiculously biased article - no surprises there.
@Western: You should read the decision in question.
I thought Sophie was a yoga teacher?
The problem with todays report cards is the same as the problem with the western world in general, TOO MUCH Political correctness!
Do you have proof that they had no control over their borders? When did Britain stop being an independent country? Blah, blah, blah. How about some evidence to back up your claims?
So who would... Gerald Butts?
The sugar substitutes ( calorie free sweeteners ) merely enhance and sustain our predilection and addiction, habituation ... for SWEET tasting junk food ...
Siddon's GDP numbers are laughable.
You are soooo naive.
The Canadian conservatives feel the same way. Loudly. Very loudly.
I don't believe that Ms Wente was ever employed by the TDSB.
Depends on how you count your chickens.
And yet you guys endorsed the previous Conservative government, lead by Stephen Harper, 3 times, complete with it's approach to this issue. What were you thinking???
It is part of the whole process. This is China's replacement for the World Bank. The CIPS system is being developed concurrently. You can't have one without the other.
calgary - I hear that cannibalism really isn't Harper's thing. It's Kittens that are his favourite snack.
right and the published financial statements have so little detail you could drive a tank through them
Know 'when to stop' what?
Do you have $20 billions to spare?
rarely, even in these pedestrian g&m chatrooms, has such an uneducated response been posted. what is a traditional frenchman to you?a visigoth?
Not voting is not an option, unless you plan to vote BC Liberal.
Well said. It is how we conduct ourselves in such ?open and shut? cases that reaffirms our judicial practices and reassures us that justice is being carried out fairly in other cases where the verdict is not assured.
Voters may be dumb, but not dumb enough to make a trip to Israel as a big deal. I know I don't. Sounds more like a taxpayer funded junket to me.Mind you if I was invited I would have went too.
You mean unified like if Quebec, the second largest province, never accepted to ratify the constitution of your country? Wonder if you would think the same if ontario had been in that situation for 35 years...
95% may not be the correct number, but it would not be far off the right number of those who knew much about what his media job(s) were.
SNC lobbied the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister pressured the Attorney General. The Attorney General said no. The Prime Minister removed this Attorney General. Enough of this political Mumbo jumbo.
Define terrorist. Bill C-51 doesn't.You could be a terrorist.
He somehow forgot to work in climate change, his other pet project. ANother huge socialist redistribution project.
Hopefully the Wayner won't speak again for a while.
He is hardly a master...
Actually it was for about 1 hour for 1 day on a state holiday... wooohooo
people! pandas! we have PANDAs !
Yes leigh but it's probably because you've been subjected to criticism from other women your whole life. It takes a toll after awhile.
I did my research.
Are you the one zapping posts here ?
Typical of Ms. Wente: Exploiting and sensationalizing the subject she pretends to critisize!
The Liberal elitists who are voting for 'pretty' call others pathetic. Now that's funny. Let's face it this kid isn't very bright.
the word you want is 'centrist'...
'lack of ethics is hardly news''clear when he was in a minority position''why hand him a majority?'Are you sure you are not talking about the Ontario Liberals?
Dear eighttigers, No. Best regards, The Globe and Mail
'No prediction about the 2016 race has proved accurate to this point'No prediction YOU have made, Yakker.
Not to mention, build decks (under the table) on their paid off days.
I don't really mind this fair trade stuff but the undocumented workers motion was probably the worst thing council has done since 2010. Also just give it up on the shark fins if it was some Halal dish nobody would attempt to ban it.
In diverse Toronto it is not always obvious when there is someone of FN background so the stereotyping and racism are less evident - Edmonton provides a valuable perspective for Canada Mayor @DonIveson speech https://goo.gl/d50k7V #cdnpoli
No they don't.
Why did the "media" not ask this sooner, rickschlosser?
6000 wounded by bullets in 3 months?. Pure propaganda. But a good start if it were true.
Trudeau was helping an MP to his seat when he was attacked. For shame dippers.
You forgot that one about teaching a person to fish.......
A form of censorship? Bury your comments 10 pages back even tho you just posted them.
you're saying trump has an enemies list. Yup, certainly. but since trump has no chance in hades, not a problem.
so what is Chretein saying Canada should propose peace talks with ISIS? what a joke
Now what? How about waiting until the legislation is actually tested by people with the authority to make a ruling?
Not very amusing. But someone was bound to make that lame joke before long........
Hear! Hear! The Globe's Editorial Board owes the Canadian public an apology for its endorsements of The Harper Government?.
'our bad' really?
Anything to keep Tim out of office... Don't get me wrong I don't think the Liberals should be there after what they did but I certainly think we will be worse off with the know-it-all Tim Hudak in there...
The Swedes have the situation in hand.
Lisa needs braces.
A Chretien fan, are you Richard?
No, they're saying phase it out and stop breeding whales in captivity. What is so complicated to understand about that?
LOL modern? Read history and you will find what you want has been tried and failed.
You may be right, but personally I believe CBC, Toronto Star and this paper will make sure he never loses his lustre.
Don't you just hate the "good old days"?
Thank you Globe, for putting on your editorial page what is on the minds of many Canadians, including many posters to this board.
Tell that to First Nations people.
The most surprising thing to me is that you were surprised at German attitudes towards immigration.
Perhaps you should re-read the article. She is mentioned.
You're dreadfully mis-informed. So sad ... so unnecessary.
There is a lot of abuse in the workplace. Many careers and lives are damaged because of it.Been there, done that.
Renouncing is also a good way to trigger an audit. Go for it.
..and they also lost their heads.
Funny. He kept getting democratically elected.
I find it hard to believe that 'the centre' could have such a thin conception of what 'economic development' means with respect to the Kinder Morgan proposal. There's no jobs to come from it. It's all risk and no reward!
This is all well and good but thunderstorms are not strictly a summer phenomena.
I really don't understand what you mean. What local religious schools and what has personal choice to do with it?
Are you going to share Obama's 'intelligence' with us, Ericka?
Chavez 'bombastic rhetoric' is certainly no more ludicrous than Stephen Harper's. Cue Harpo's self-serving, hypocritical and ill-conceived official statement following Chavez' death.
Yes, but you don't understand. The Gibsons of this world have no time for the law or rights. Why can't you just do as you're told?
The alternative was a 10 story sculpture of Steve playing the piano and singing Hey Jude.....
Give up Thompson Wienies. You are losers
Another failed product of failed Kanadian Education EH?
The reference was simply to refer to an 'armed conflict' and had nothing to do with citizenship of any of the participants. You read far too much into the reference.
Interesting but not reallyGoogle 'remarkably impervious to change' and you get hundreds of hits. The use of tired cliche's may be irritating but falls short of plagiarism.
Rather than a stupid rebuke, how about a sensible response?
hmmmwhy wait?
Drastic immigration reform is required. However, political correctness/cowardice will preclude it.
If you are looking for cuckoos try looking in the mirror!
All persons legally in Canada should be allowed to work under the same conditions as any Canadians. The fact that we make it so difficult for people to legally work here invites abuse of all kinds.
harper, can't trust Jr.
The F-35 cannot be detected at long range. it has a powerful IRST (infrared search and track) system that can detect approaching aircraft. They will be fine in a defensive. role in our arctic. The US and Norway will be using them for arctic patrols.
Great post - and actual data !Would'nt want too many of those or politics as we know them would come to an end .-)
Don't let Franklin Allen's comment poison the whole thread. Besides, there's reason to think his comment was done to provoke. Just what is unclear.
What a pleasant thought.
this is a hard one -- usually, if Yakabuski says it, it's wrong but here, KY is sort of on to something... hard to figure
It's not that the unshaven look bad (even though they usually do), it's that grown, mature men in North America are superstitious. Do they also avoid walking under ladders? Time to grow up boys and stop behaving like you're uneducated.
However, there is a whole lot of evidence, which shows that not exercising and non-healthy eating will make you fat/obese, raise your cholesterol, raise your chances of a heart attack, etc.
It's not the 'oilsands' thamselves that are the problem....it's the absolutely idiotic way inwhich they are being developed, that is. The abject stupidity and simple greed is mind boggling.
Well, some women - I'm one of them - do find them painful, but that was a stupid thing for your gym teacher to do.
I wouldn't say that out loud in Vancouver.
And you would have supported a left wing political revolution?
Think a little harder. Must everything be spoon-fed?
So the country gets to be hijacked by 30+% of those who want something else? Something undefined, but YOU want?
The purpose of the schools was not to educate. It was to kill the indian in the child. Keeping them away from home was part of the mandate to make sure they weren't influenced by their families and communities.
How can anyone vote for a presidential candidate who was 'extremely careless' with classified information and abused her position as Secretary of State to raise money for her own slush fund?
Breaking news Taxis are allowed to do surge pricing with an app bravo, consumers win, we pay more sarcasm
The god news is that this could work against him at the next election
So, it was "his week" because he ejected two MPs from his caucus over unfounded accusations? Does that mean if I approach Trudeau and accuse him of murdering puppies will he recuse himself so that a "proper" investigation can take place?
Because if she's not actively fighting, she's enjoying it. Duh.
This deal unfortunately will contribute to Saudi Arabia and likely Egypt joining a newnuclear arms race in the region. The commie-pinko leftists will then be able torationalize this deal as somehow contributing to peace in the region.
is Volonteering for a non for profit charity OK for you ?
Charles Taylor did run for the CCF & the Padlock Law was rooted in anti-semitism. Franks Scott a CCF founder, Constitutional expert and amazing Poet defeated the Padlock law.
Things are only going to get worse. There are already stories circulating of attacks on mosques in France. Nothing being reported in mainstream news as yet but through RT.com. Query why these stories are not hitting the news feeds.

My wife grew up in Ontario, and when I told her about this colum, she said : 'Bob Rae ? Is he still alive ?' I laughed
Her incompetence will be her downfall, not being gay.
What we need is one bylaw that applies without question to everybody,? he said. -------in that case make UBER pay $200,000 or whatever for a licence per car or COMPENSATE all the taxi drivers or ownersthat would be only Fair
No, just "many" rednecks on the right.
Wait - what? The CBC said they haven't received any complaints about Jian from anyone, ever. Where are you getting this info from?
Grand jury members serve a term and are chosen AT RANDOM. These members were chosen prior to the shooting even taking place. So your race baiting does not apply here.
Check what other provinces are paying in terms of salaries & benefits. Teachers pension plans approach or exceed a million dollars.
This includes the Suzukites, Goreites and their academic plebes.
Neither of those guys strike me as 'grown men.'
The Ontario peasants need to sharpen their pitch forks !
Gardiner. You missed the part of how the aliens might further the agenda as well.
Greg519. The boys in the PMO don't wear short pants. They wear brown shirts.
This particular religion is good at killing and beheading....the followers of other religions, such as the Amish, are pathetic when it comes to those particular ' skills'.
The Harper gang reveals its one-track mind, and a very narrow track at that.
The globe and Mail, where Wentes opinion keeps on crashing and burning. Good for a laugh though...
Why do so many posts on climate change devolve into an attack on Harper? Kind of diminishes the level of discussion don't you think?
Thank you for a good discussion on a well-overdue subject. I was a teen in the 60/70's and got caught up in this. I wish I had this to read back then. Keep up the great work!
Wow. A Leftist won't support any Conservative candidates. Colour me shocked. C.
So according to your logic, we should NOT sell something that we can produce and for which consumers around the world will voluntarily pay. Sounds smart.
So Mark Mackinnon, a Canadian of Nativity, should lose his rights based on this argument?
I love how Americans call me Russian
The editorial board of the G&M endorsed this government. Need I say more? I will. The country's democratic institutions will not be protected by the media or business leaders who are only interested in their own agendas.
' A smart move would be to support the ideas of the Leap Manifesto'That would be really really stupid.
Weird, you miss the point. Our 1.5% (and that's what it is for 2013) is insignificant. Yes we will suffer the consequences of climate change but there is virtually nothing Canada can do about it. Your rambling argument is not particularly logical.
Yes, one tragic photo now drives immigration policy in the West. If the child had been Iraqi they'd been on their way here. And what are you going to do if they don't pay off the debt?
Bud, google "Mike Harris fiscal policies in Ontraio" and come back and tell us how that's different than what you are claiming... and you Cons all get wood at the mere mention of the name "Mike Harris"...Canada's Ronald Reagan
Putin won, the US caused the situation in Ukraine and it backfired on them. Glory to Russia a country of proud people.
Not sure why your comment got downvoted. It's totally true.
This may be an 'Awakening'???, but only for those that were already asleep at the wheel. It is not a question of these folks adjusting or blending in to the new society quickly or easily, it is a question of 'if at all'.
Quazz, I hope you apply that comment across the political spectrum.
But that is trickle down economics -the conservative Reagan mantra.
DieterHH - I was being sarcastic, which I think you know but thought I would make sure...
If He did you would openly attack it without reading first...

Look up the word 'purport' JB, clearly you don't know what it means or have the ability to read my full sentence. You either have an amazing ability to hear exactly what you want to hear, or you are incredibly intellectually dishonest.
I gather you have not been to Israel. It is a Jewish State and within the Jewish State, you can be Christian, Moslem, Bahai, or anything you want openly.
This is important research and it is shameful that this government would rather put its head in the sand than help us build evidence that will help us cope with the changes that are now inevitable.
That's the only play they know.
and we are not corrupt? you must be mad!
Denise... I am so sorry... for you, for me, for all of us.
_Parliament_ needs to review the mandate, since it's set out in legislation.
That's correct, but there are a lot of Americans living in Canada and some of them will vote.
If it's 'their' problem, why are ministers here bragging about bombing runs in Syria?
Absolutely right Teleology and we have seen successive deficits ever since. It's hard to believe that they are running on sound financial management.
warbirds, it's a pretty simple google search to inform yourself but if you'd prefer a poster here to educate you on this then offer some $$. BTW the search needs less typing than your post.
And was promptly voted in again by the Canadian electorate as PM. Swing and a miss there Bobby!
Don't worry......Bubble Head Trudeau will know what to do....
That's it? That's the best you can do on the 'post-factual world'? Sell out.
Don't mention the war; I think I did but got away with it....
That's because a lot of the 'protests' are racist and bigoted. If the shoe fits...
What's wrong with the monarchy? It's far away, mostly irrelevant, and keeps us from constitutional discussions as to what to replace it with. I would put Harper's bet on oil far higher as a problem, relative to the monarchy.
Not if you consider that the family with two modest income earners has to pay for childcare that the high earner doesn't. Not to mention that it also appears to be a policy geared to encouraging women to stay at home (where they belong?).
great Malumba shows Great Desperation scraping the bottom of every battle looking for anti Harper dirtkeep on scraping
No. Fair comment. However, hypothesizing large numbers of assaults with no data to back it up doesn't make for a sound basis for policy-making.
Keep political correctness out of the Globe!
'Farmers get some $6 billion to $8 billion in welfare every year.'Do you have a source for this ridiculous claim? There are only about 200, 000 farms left in Canada. You are claiming that they average about $30,000 to $40,000 in 'welfare' each year?
You do understand the Liberals were in charge the majority of the time from 2001 - 2009 don't you?
Yeah it's a mess. And it's the fault of your right-wing spiritual cousins in the US Congress, you monstrous hack.
You are these country trolls, wise old Tony?
I can't accept that Harper is a Serial abuser of power. The geek in me objects. He had so many scams going at once that he is definitely a Parallel abuser of power.
C'mon, Sam, yer Liberal creds turn to crud when you mention Jack in the same sentence as the lying pack out of the Calgary School.
Montreal is even adding considerable amount of seperated bike lanes. Alao the Bixi program is quite the success (it has problems to work out though) in Montreal that it is expanding there and being adopted in many other cities.
So, then, this is the first time you've noticed...
You jest Re the all the media in Canada is right wing???
nice try. how much were you paid?
Mr Rae. you, above anyone else, can attest to the fact that political miracles (nightmares) can happen.
Who today is truly as 'good' as Bain, Fisher, Lynch, McGillvray, Newman and Val Sears. More broadminded way back then. 'Less 'angry.'
'Unbelievable- and not a sniff from the media.' Then how did you find out about it?
My local public libray is the crown jewel of my small suburb. Much of the money to build it came from local wealthy people writing checks to the building fund.
Please read more carefully-I was talking about my son's friend and not the guy in the link
And it's as obvious now as it was then why that was a good endorsement.
Well it could have been worse you could have called me justin.
Human rights 'advancing' is precisely why we have most of the problems we have today. Everybody has a right to have the gov take care of them while taking no reposibility for themselves. It is quite ridiculous.
no, authors of opinion pieces
Ahh... the old russian encirclement fantasy... what proportion of russia's borders are adjacent to NATO countries?
Third World leaders are better educated than many first world ones. For example, Harper dropped out of U of T, and could finish his degree in (what was then) a mediocre university.
If I had a son who was an incompetent president he'd look like...

You needn't lie to support Trudeau. Your anger isn't winning Liberal converts.
Clinton prepares for debates like any normal person unlike Trump who just can't tear himself away from the ego trip of the adoration of the "poorly educated", ha, ha, ha.

I cried when I was married, cried with the birth of our first child and I cried last night getting our country back! I suspect it was a very emotional night for many of us.
And they always have.
60 years of involvement and the politicians are all the same. The task of a new government is to find new ways of interfering in our lives. We are now a fascist country. Anybody want evidence?
not once not twice but three timesrepeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity
Well, thank you, for identifying "socialists" as the only ones who care about human rights. You could be right.

Any actual intelligent arguments refuting the facts in the article? Didn't think so.
I could come up with a formula for counting that guaranteed your preferred candidate would never be elected.
Excellent opinion, the article's writer forgets some readers are capable to call her bluff.
Stop the nonsense! Harper left a major structural deficit.
Keep hoping
How about getting a funny bone :-))
'If maple syrup exploded and killed a lot of children in a school, there would be outrage.' It's so true. Thank goodness we don't market exploding syrup.

What's the job situation like in Windsor? It's easy to tell people they can move but when one city has a disproportionate number of jobs relative to everywhere else it's very diffucult to consider other options.

yes, that overwhelming 39%
It's reins, milkcan. Otherwise I agree with you.
So now it's O.K. for Globe readers to comment on the words and actions of Mayor Ford. Interesting.
Hey Kevie!
You may not care about your Charter rights, but the rest of us do. The Charter of Rights protects Canadians against "unreasonable search and seizure."
Now if we could only bring democratic values to our bought and paid for Canadian newsprint media.

That is what the national shipbuilding program is designed to do, build the capability, and stretch it out forever - no more boom and bust.
And when was the last time conservatives tried to shut down a Clinton or a Sanders rally? Yet, liberals and progressives have taken it upon themselves to prevent the right of Trump to free speech.
Whereas Harperrhoid and Puffy have no shame whatsoever.

There was video of a black protester punching a white man at the Chicago rally a couple days ago, but you won't hear that at the Globe because it doesn't fit their narrative.
What does the oath have to to do with the controversy over Justice Ginsburg's comments?
Typical answer form those who will not look at the real data. try it and you will find NOAA, NASA, MET, and many more government site data sets to look at. They come back and we will talk.
Dalton is not a crook!!! He is incompetent!!! Big Difference.
Educate, Moseby. Find out what "critical infrastructure" means. And guess what? 80% of it is in private hands. The idea of nationalizing anything important is so pathetically old-fashioned it's not even worth considering.
Give just ONE example, please.
This comment from someone with the word Ottawa as part of their handle.
I'm saying theres a need and a way to reform prisons and how they deal with problematic prisoners without bringing race into it at all
Where to start deconstructing your idiocy, if it's even worth bothering? I'll stick with noting Chretien is 81 and Martin 77, both older than the mandatory Senate retirement age of 75.
Martin is the one that paid down the debt and left the surpluses that Harper squandered and the EI thing was found by the SCC to be legal. There's some facts for you moon. Your turn.
Good comments and I agree - why the thumbs down? Unless it's the comment about rape 'culture'?
Campaigning for that vacancy on SIRC perhaps?
What has he accomplished? Really ,what? Good feelings are NOT policy.
Very Astute Rant.
This article brought to you by the Harper government and the major oil companies.
Deflection, spin 1.5 out of 10
Harper wouldn't be fit to carry PET's shoes.
A very moving article, and one very appropriate for modern society.
The article was reprinted from American papers, Dufus. ..
Joey- that goes for the Economic Action Plan ads also I presume?
For Israel detractors ISIS is a stabilizing force.
Papa. The name of the Army was not changed to Royal.
I've never trusted computers anyway. I don't pay any bills online, or put any personal information online. It's scary enough that much of my personal info is already on line through my bank, my doctor, my dentist, my employer and my creditors.
Reasons to fear for humanity...........
Charles Taylor has run (and lost) for the Federal NDP 4 times.
In Scotland, the minimum election voting age is 18. This was a referendum, not an election, and the minimum age was lowered to 16.
a very accurate analysis of what happened. but that won't stop the media from repeating their same failures over and over until there is no one left to turn out the lights. Traditional media is a declining industry like Canada Post
You're not the only one who has travelled a fair bit. I dare say you're deluding yourself.
Great post. It really is about taking everything possible right now.
Oh come on Doug, admit you're happy with the outcome. Millions displaced and fleeing into the west so we can become more multicultural.
Your wrong. People who want a deliberate pre meditated murderer to have any possibility of living free again rank in a slender minority. Sadly, no actually angrily that minority happens to encompass our unelected judiciary
connect with the west? speak for yourself. I feel connected as a westerner. i think you meant 'connect with the right wing nut jobs that contaminate the west'
And also to make sure that we have a great primary and secondary school education system and strong universities. That is something the provincial gov't actually has control over.
Notice that the article mentioned advantages for businesses and consumers, but not for workers.
Property taxes are high in Dallas and Houston as well.
A nation that elects a tattooed teenager 1%er because of his last name to a majority will re-elect this guy for a long time.
sounds like a sore looser. Get over it and get on with the day.
cnpp, another question. If the topic of Gender Dysphoria (i.e., transgenderism) isn't at least touched on how will your kids react the first time they have a trans* classmate? Or teacher?
These clowns in the main street media just don't get it. Nobody cares what you say. Your opinions are bought and paid for by the elites. Trump all the way!!!!!
I don't know how I'll be able to get through the rest of the day, let alone my life, not being able to believe everything Mia Farrow says or ever said. Thanks a lot, Margaret...
Remember this is Nanos, so the re al situation must be far worse. Perhaps there is hope for Canada.
So why did Elizabeth May vote against the motion, Granatstein? It should always be remembered when reading pieces by Granatstein that he is an arch Conservative.
You are in the minority. Most Canadians want the pipeline and the benefits that help our country. If we listened to alarmists all the time we would still be in the dark ages.
Trump certainly DID lose the debate!!! And he will llose all the debates - because he is a spoiled little brat who should be given a spankiing - thats right a spoiled little brat!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't get the sense that PKP has the Burlesque-oni bunga-bunga factor going for him, which is probably just as well, especially for underage strippers.
You haven't been following the polls.
JohnDThere are times when someone's actions are so egregious that normal standards of etiquette don't apply
The Press is Special. So says the Press. It has always been thus.
And thats the Liberal policy EH ? wait for Harper to self distruct. Lib4ever you belie your youth with the bullying statement and should look up 'Rat Pack '. And I don't mean Dean Martin and Frank.
Well written. Though I think there are other factors at play in this (the narcissism of social media, etc. etc.). Still?fresh, interesting, compelling writing.
Stop it Kathleen.
Apparently lots of people don't like what you have to say, but it only proves the old maxim: the truth hurts. You're right, of course. Eventually time will prove it so.
"What we need to create is a system that gives people dignity and opportunity." Quite a general statement, I would think. Please give an example of a country that has succeeded in doing such?
All good and obvious points. A wee bit of redemption for the 1982 flashback column on women in combat.

Wondering which bodily orifice you pulled the $36B from....
I wonder how high taxes can go? Can Justin's good looks compensate for less money in our pockets?
Saunders concludes that democracy is a threat to itself. Not surprising since he works 24/7 for the plutocracy.
Here's a link to when they actually admitted this: https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/promises-vs-political-speeches-tories-honesty-214912299.html
Not true. It was late, but he was no where near the plant leg. Watch it again.
In my humiliating opinion, if you want to be left without a right, left to write your own last rite, you have to realize that the left is right and the right is wrong. :)
Could that be because Trump leads the Republican nomination? And possibility because people get beaten up at his rallies and he has even been heard to call from the stage for participants/protestors he doesn't like to be beaten?
'the days when feminism was about something meaningful...'Oh, yeah, I forgot... like burning bras...

I heart Tabatha Southey's mom. By the way, I do the same thing with my MP's (conservative) questionnaires.
Very thoughtful post. Must take an IQ over 50.
'First things first, but which are the first things?' Very good question, in fact. It seems the most important are cigarettes, dope, and Toronto. What a travesty.
We need a PM who actually does his job instead of wasting so much time and money trying to discredit the leader of a party that is not even the official opposition. Is harper that worried? talk about being in way over ones head.
MK - give me a break, you're Simpson's biggest fan when he criticizes Harper but when he points the spotlight on your hare- brained LPC leader all of a sudden it's a different story.
Well put. 'Vote for us to think for you' is how we get disenfranchised.
I think this might work to the cops advantage. When the public realizes the ridiculous crap cops have to put up with, they will probably be more sympathetic. And as for the rogue cops, hopefully it will keep them in line.
However, public utilities are money-makers, so if these local distribution companies are privatized and consolidated, I'd certainly invest my retirement savings in them!
Clinton keeps bugging Trump to let her peak at his private tax returns, when what Hilliary should really be doing is releasing The Clinton Foundation bank account records.
Refineries that can handle dilbit exist throughout Asia... South Korea just ran a test batch of Alberta dilbit.
And one and all are trolls for the Conservatives
I noticed that as well. Also I seems I have to login for every article, something logs me out. Our comments over the last few years must be having effect. BDS! BDS! BDS!
well JT is asking you to 'trust him'...good luck with that
Dear MMackinnon ...I mean, the US progressive movement of the 1890s is the first use of the term as a political label.... ------ at that time the word did not mean "leftist" now it does ask yourself why are leftists ashamed to be called leftists
I think they realize it.
GeorgeIt's not that the rich can't, it's they don't want to.
Why is it 'elitist' to oppose having a language that's not part of your family's or country's history being forced upon you?
Actually, they rent it for 6 months. Then parliament addresses whether or not to stay involved, and the new decision gets new ownership.
actually, the president of the united states has his finger on the nuclear button. once pressed, it's rather difficult to 'overturn' that kind of decision.
What a stupid comment. Go away
You hope in vain. Being ideologically driven the Conservative party will go back to its reform roots. The progressive conservatives, let alone red tories, have long ago become a marginalized force in the Conservative party.
Wake up dave, harper added $150 billion to the debt. you are talking total trash
I believe Jazman3 meant to say part-time mayor
I suspect Putin is not crying in his vodka that he didn't have to listen to a Harper rendition of -- any Beatles song. Who advised Harper that he could sing anyway? Truly dangerously delusional.
You think CTV is any better?
Having a foreign policy that is not centred around Big Oil profit margins will look a little different than what the Reform Party Cult had in mind for our future.
That would be a stereotype (look it up in the dictionary) with the same miniscule amount of truth to it that most stereotypes have.

Pupatello may become the leader of a party that hopefully should get less support than the green party.
Of course it's biased it's a column. It shocks me how many people don't understand the difference between a column and an article. And Enbridge may be Canadian but it's foreign funded.
Super-size me, and pick-up my health care expenses please.
The part left out of this propaganda piece is that these properties had previously been confiscated by Palestinians from Jews. A story in a Palestinian propaganda rag does not count as objective reporting.
Correct to 'moerbrugge' is back.
Politics trumps policy across the board with Harper and his wankers.
Good God Observer, you live in a very narrow fantasy world! Get out and see what reality is!
monkey, I'm delighted that India, Poland, China, Estonia, Ukraine, and Mexico are becoming more like Canada but how happy can you be that Canada is becoming more like India, Poland, China, Estonia, Ukraine and Mexico?
Nope. It's the tactic of a candidate who has zero respect for the mainstream media. (pssst....and neither do most Americans)
It wasn't hard to fact check the stories on Teresa Spence's hunger strike, all you had to do was look at her to know it was all complete nonsense. But our subsidized media told us she was gonna die of starvation!

Even if Barber DID say what he's accused of, he certainly wasn't lying! Isn't it high time for Creepy Crawley to let the poor chap out of Purgatory?
And so is the associated 9-year nightmare.
Why do the Harperites all fail to address actual issues in favour of bashing their opponents? Oh, right - it's what you've got.

Bravo Quebec! Continue dans cette bonne voie.
The author blames animal cruelty on 'cheap' food on the unproven assumption that animal cruelty is a necessary condition for production of affordable food. Sloppy. Editors evidently asleep again.
What's wrong with a referendum? Week and weeks of asinine negative Conservative adds trying to scare the bejeebus outta people. That is what is wrong with a referendum.
I'm not talking about subsidies.
O'Leary would be Odin's gift to the Liberal Party. He could never fake concern for the downtrodden like Trump does.
How does being one of the founders of the White Supremacist Group, The Northern Foundations qualify Harper to be PM.
I agree with pretty much all you said, but Canada1 isn't wrong in the fact that the far-right going super racist is worse than the far left going super anti-racist. Regardless, as you mention, stigmatization into tribes doesn't help anyone.
A lot of angry rednecks on this site. I'm starting to think most of you hostile people who are on here all the time are angry for a reason. I'm guessing you're divorced, unemployed or both.
"these are kids who need to be trained in the way the (sic) should go." Wow. Don't you realize this was the same "reasoning" used to hit wives, apprentices, and servants? The time has come to stop this awful practice of hitting kids.

As a non-status Aboriginal Canadian, I agree with your comments....that said, the 'Indian industry' (which includes many non-Aboriginals) won't like hearing the reality of this sad situation.

You're quite right./..
Naughty boy, you aren't supposed to say that.
Margaret Wente- are you ever judgeMENTAL!
ShaunnarinePrecisely my thoughts, and those of many of my professional colleagues. How Harpers ' not fit to govern' smear campaign ever got legs is beyond me.
Parts of the establishment Republican party are starting to resemble this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eMkth8FWno
You are right. They were also opposed to the Irish/Italians etc when they came and made their lives difficult. we (Canadians who are all immigrants) have claimed Canada as ours, which rightly belongs to native americans.
Kelly Leitch is a CONservative, you tool.
absolutely. I know commentators can reach and project their conceit too far just to capture clicks and eyeballs, but this one is halfway to Mars.
Perhaps you should learn that there is a difference between an adult capable of rational thought and a two year old. What works for one does not work for the other.
Ah - just like North American perpetrators of political propaganda - regrettably inclusive of our brain dead media ....
So much hatred, I guess cold war is missed by westerners a lot. Gives purpose.
Your irrational Sy. Completely irrational. And that is the best thing that I can say about you.
Hardly a valid comparison.
Harper has messed up everything he has touched. Everything. He's had a 9 year audition for the part and still cannot seem to grow into it.He blew it.
Thank you. Keep fighting the good fight!
Excellent chart, diane marie, thanks. It's noteworthy also that Trudeau's lowest debt to GDP ratio was 10% and the debt in constant dollars actually went down until the mid-70s, before the global economic downturn.
It is the Globe and mail after all .This is to be expected
Becoming POTUS is a two step process. Becoming PM is a four step process. Pretty uneven odds.
I agree with Ambrose. However his/her comment is in search of another column to attach itself to.
Of course you are getting tired roch because when asked a simple question you deflect....was Pence telling the truth? If you don't think Billionaires should pay taxes good for you... but answer the question.. I'll answer any you like.. :)
actually, it is you who is not objective Canadians voted the CPC a majorty based on this policy
Nice, Sally. With friends like you ...
harper's pigeons at work
And how does that dovetail into the way the only possible alternative seems to be intent on utterly destroying their own credibility?
Compromise! Harry Reid has shelved almost 100 percent of bills pass by the Republican congress. The Democrats got what they deserved.
i suggest you read the last Governor's remarks in todays paper. His point is that an agreement was made signed and agreed to. He expects China to live up to that agreement, not to reinterpret to their liking.
What Trudeau is saying is nothing anyone else would say given the chance. It is only common sense for those who believe in fairness. Trudeau has handlers pretend that someone is standing behind him talking.
Tabarnouche. Opposition is there only to respond.
How are cheap oil, Harper?s phony contingency fund, Harper?s mysterious surplus (burp), Dean Del Mastro, Mike Duffy, Pamela Wallin, Joe Oliver, Tom Flanagan, Alberta's deficit, Jim Prentice and the Alberta Conservatives doing in Calgary today?
And of course the same rules should apply to the unions. i am sure you agree..
The Warkerton tragedy was caused by a drunken employee lying on the water quality reports. This had nothing to do with Harris
'May be' and 'will be' are two different things. If you listed every substance encountered by the human condition that 'may be' harmful and acted to avoid them, you would never leave the house.
Trudeau turns 44 in a couple of months. That is far from 'young' and some of the stuff he says, you'd think he'd know better by now. Again, he's 43, he's 23. Grow up.
It's worked so far in every school that has done it.
but is that due to our housing bubble? Lots of renovations, easy to do when your house has gone up in value 16% just this year
Substance free, so I'll take that to mean that you have nothing, aog.
Remember? Harper was only a few years older than Trudeau and also "wet behind the ears" (he had never even had any 'real' job) when he led the Cons to the first, minority government.
"Razor blades are essential." No, they aren't. Beards don't hurt us, and we could keep them in check with scissors if razors weren't available. Most of us don't want beards, but that is our choice.

They didn't become hypocrites--they grew up, had their own kids and realized their parents and teachers may have had a point after all.

Despite the fawning media adulation of that thoroughly underwhelming Jane Sterk the Greens are going to lay a big turd. Not one seat. All hype and no show.

Yes, absolutely. Corruption is the polio epidemic that is paralyzing development in the world.

Yes, she is as blatant as blatant can be. I know it's an opinion column, but she has always been less than honest in her columns.
Correction, it's only partially your money. The government loaned you the tax you would otherwise have paid when you contributed to your RRSP and it wants that money back as agreed when you contributed to the plan.
No politician will call Israel to the mat to end the brutal occupation and control of the Palestinian People. Any other country would be damned, but Israel can do what Israel pretty well wants . And why is that?

It must be terrible to live in such fear... of everything. As one human to another, I feel bad for you.
Well said. Written in a clear and understandable way.
My economics 101 tell me that no matter how much tax the government, especially left government will collect, it will blow through it all and then run the deficit anyway, asking for more tax next year.
I agree with you , particularly around Mr.Manning. I feel like we have little to choose from leader wise. But, I'm also not certain how much it will matter.( and I understand that is " the unspeakable " in a political charged comments board)
2001 Census in Ukraine - primary language: Ukrainian speakers: 37,541,693 Russian speakers: 8,334,141 6 other languages Polish speakers: 144, 130 Care to provide a source for your statement that 35% of Ukraine's population is Polish?

I think there are plenty of statistics out there which show apathy of Muslims or outright admiration for Sharia law or fundamentalist Islam.
The Liberals are caught in the middle with nothing to offer, representing no real alternative, between two parties that actually do. Trudeau's leadership has been inept and callow.
Get over it.
Damn, so many teacher posting on a weekend. Do you not usually leave that until a workday?
With that attitude you must definitely not like the new Pope who is peeling back the skin on capitalism and me-ism..

Ah yes !! The G & M elite's version of 'freedom of opinion'. Just a FEW times for moi as well !!
She's not in government.
Too bad I liked Doug Ford.
I don't wish any personal harm to Harper. I just want him to do some time, and then disappear from Canadian politics forever.
Awww, poor Steve, he can't do ANYTHING because even in a majority his laws have to be constitutional! Stupid constitution, it ruins all the fun!!
good luck with that. Auzzies have backbone.
J.S. Woodsworth weeps over what the NDP has become.
Harper has no issues with 'Integrity'.He simply does not believe in it. Period.

Oh, and you forgot to give your own post a "thumbs up". You're slipping...
Lamont, roughly 1% of the population is intersex. Many don't know it and it's only discovered during an autopsy. Historically even the parents weren't necessarily told.
We need education to be accountable to the taxpayers, if they fail at making kids numerate or literate, fix it!
...a broken record with nothing on it.
You mentioned neither in your previous post. Is this revisionist arguing.
@Canada1 thus saving the employers many millions in matching contributions. ----- it also saves YOU the CONSUMER stop pretending otherwise
So, only right wingers do politics? Wow, what a well-articulated point of view you develop here, sirencall. Impressive.
@JimmieB "Baby Trudeau"????? Way to stagger us with your incisive wit.
Designated non-texter driver.
You hit the nail on the head with the biggest problem with Harper: He is simply NOT a good person.
Posting on G&M comment sites for pennies from the Liberal party.
Has there ever been another person that has made a fool of so many Liberals in so short of time?
See, there's your mistake right there - nothing by US American is ever above when one sorts posts by popularity.
Correct on a number of accounts. Possibly true of all the Western democracies?
Yeah, we all know male presidential candidates are only 36 or so, right? Puh-leeze. Dole was 73, McCain 72. Detalumis check your facts.
learn martial arts if you want to protect your home. man up and stop being a right wing sissy
I'd take Sanders over Clinton. She has already proved that she isn't up for the job as she has been in already. My second choice is Trump.
Thanks. After reading some of the other responses, that made me smile.
Ah, Grasshopper, I suppose the $315 Billion dollar debt doesn't exit either? Oops must have slipped the mind.....
Only in Canada would the RCMP be engaged to intercept 6-packs of beer at the provincial borders !I won't post any more about this since my keyboard would go up in flames .-)
[Probably not, but we need to start somewhere.] Start with yourself.
This article is absolutely worthless. Harper is a coward, a poor leader, and an ideologue
you realize that testosterone is a steroid, right?
But why put more money into a system that is flawed? I disagree, that without further funding we will be left with an inadequate transportation system. Translink doesn't need more money they need competition - things like Uber.
When was the Globe editorial board *not* a shill for Harper and his cronies?
"Prostitution derives from poverty." No it doesn't, it is the result of demand and the willingness of someone to supply the service.
Define "we."
That's not the topic of this article... it is about how people value what they use. Health care 'feels' free to people and they use it accordingly.
Yeah imagine you can buy beer in a grocery store... what an imposition it has been....
On land, the clean up technology is the same tried and true dig up and securely landfill the contaminated ground regardless of crude or did it being spilled.
Your lies aren't working.
So who are we stuck with now? His evil twin?
Thanks, Don227. I thought so too...
why'd you read it?
Proper journalism would have the information I requested included in the article. Awareness of same used to be taught in school............
The only thing I am left thinking after reading this is 'so what'?I fail to understand why this was printed....
But the grocery stores will just pay a fee to carry those european 6 packs. And the beer will be heavily taxed. And you'll pay more for groceries so the grocery store doesn't eat the cost of the fee.
Let us see Harper's secretive background. Put his thesis on line with the rest of the Master and doctoral thesis Canadian universities have produced. I guess a thesis done in crayon doesn't scan very well.
I agree that the status of women in China has improved a lot, especially compared to India, but1. it is still not enough2. it started before the Communism took over.
Not Jealous, disgusted!!!
Obama is NOT a liberal. By any standard other than that of hard-right Americans, Obama is a fairly hard-line conservative, as opposed to the Republican which is dominated by the lunatic right wing.(In American parlance, RWNJs.)
What mind?
And have two separate twitter accounts, no point in seeing a French post that I can not read.
Sure Michael Byers, we will cancel the order , if you step up and compensate the workers in London Ont. the lost wages they would have been receiving for the next 15 years. What no?
You realize that the assets of the Ontario Teachers Plan are to provide for pension for retired teachers and not available for the general use by Ontarions. The Alberta Heritage Trust Fund, on the other hand, belongs to all Albertans.
same old reform party thinking, you say one the records show ten of his biggest, truth bites!!
Al, be that as it may, your problems are rather insignificant compared to those whose lives are at risk. All you are risking is at most a hundred bucks a year in higher taxes. You don't represent me.
I like the study showing lower IQs correlate highly with right wing tendenciesneed some certainty in your life? like authority? is thinking for yourself too much trouble? vote conservative
Shorter Simpson: Nazi bashers display a dangerous lack of worldliness
Remember that if Harper cured cancer, the leftists would be screaming about him destroying jobs. Justin could kill babies on live TV and they would applaud him for something, probably 'environmental stewardship'.
It is easy more complicated than that simplistic analysis indicates.
The NYT is actually one of the best newspapers in the World with a daily circulation of 1,865,318. A paid conbot not liking that article. Who woulda thunk ?
That being the case you should be ecstatic... The individual income tax rate is much higher than what the corporation pays. More money for your programs.
After the McGuinty/Wynne years this province will have to do far worse than Harris ever thought of to straighten out our finances.
When it is my time to go I don't want anybody hovering ..... !!
On the other hand, I don't think calling The Globe's corrective morality into question is a bad idea.
This was no political satire. Ms. Notley has just gone through Alberta's worst disaster and deserves more than this.
It's too bad as we need some positive thoughts these days. We live in an age of fear and dread, and politicians only fuel that mentality.
No . . . his hatred of women has nothing to do with me. I don't condone it, I am not responsible for it, I didn't commence , I couldn't correct it. Someone else's shortcomings aren't a reflection of me simply because he and I share a common gender.
Your infantile style is unmistakable -- I bet that you and your buddies miss your old playpen at the Sun.
it is all about the state of Israel being a war criminal
My mistake G&M censors. You're still a bunch of ninnies though...
Yes, and it also suggests why Harper has tried repeatedly to stack the Supreme Court with illegal appointees - such as Nadon. And I quite agree about the dire situation in the US.
Very Very Funny. Thomas Paine was my Dad's fav... I got the reference. Nothing much needs be said after that.

I love you Seth.
So 'Natives' should dismantle the system that Canada set up? The reserve system was not 'Apartheid-style' as Apartheid was based on the reserve system. That is like calling a chicken 'egg-style'. Time to read a non-biased history book.
smoker bans were the trial balloon for more attacks against personal and parental autonomy. Sugar, salt, booze and etc have now been 'deemed' 'the new tobacco' using the exact same tactics to 'denormalize' (segregation and hatred) consumers.

Successful businesses have been using the budget process to tell a story. A business cannot cut its way to success. For governments increasing taxes is not increasing sales.
talk about skewing the factsthe 'unarmed person' you are referring to initiated violence, was on top of the victim pounding his face and threatened him with his death. But it appears from your argument, weight class should have special legal rights?
And how come it's us ordinary folk who were so easily able to see that our emperor has no clothes. Aren't journalists supposed to have superior noses to the rest of us? Isn't that why we're supposed to read them?
Is it April Fools already?? This article can't possible be serious, must be an April Fools joke.
Look... a squirrel! No...don't talk about Trump... talk about Crooked Hillary instead!
> The gay people are trying too hard to be recognized as equal or normal or whatever you want to call it...Yes, because of people like you, who hate and oppress them.
I don't know what is in this agreement but if it REQUIRES countries with fresh water to give it to those who don't (but could with desalination) then it is a good thing we backed out.
Maybe Rob Ford needs a car, but does he need an SUV?
Yes, name recognition is all he has going for him. That being said, nobody that voted for him even bothered to learn anything about his dad... and that was luck for him. Justin Bieber would have had the same chances before his DWI.

if i walk into a bank, airport , luxury condo etc a Security cameras takes my photo why is the Niqab wearer exempted how do "progressives" rationalize this ?
Good thing this did not happen at a Quebec university or the writers comments wouldHave been far more negative Robert tGatineau quebec
Rogue: That was then. This is now.
That is very true. Thing is it's also very common, most countries do that in similar cases and claim successful writers, athletes, scientists, etc.
They should merge fire fighters and garbage-men jobs. While they are waiting for fires they can haul out the garbage.
Sadly we have to breath whatever you're exhaling too Henry.
Multiculturalism has nothing to do with Canada. It was not how this country was built and not our founding principles. It is a liberal day dream foisted upon us by Juniors dad in the 1970s and it is a waste of government resources.
Ah yes. Still can't defend the Messiah on an article that has nothing to do with the Conservatives. So the best post you can come up withis to bring in Harper. Why can't you defend your Messiah?
You're support for the Harper version of conservatism is badly misplaced.
Wow. The criticism is getting to the Liberals. So much so that they've put in a night shift for the first time since the election.
If you switch to "private browser" in Mozilla or "incognito" in Chrome, you can read as much as you like.
I'm not her dad either, though I may well be old enough for the job, and I've been reading, enjoying and being samertenned up by Ms. Renzetti for years. If she goes to The Guardian I may well move back to Britain.
I agree Commune, even some teachers today barely qualify as educated people, let alone people who teach others. The standards have been dropping for decades.
Ms Leitch is proof positive that having a degree doesn't mean one is educated.
In a short while we'll need a monument to how we survived the Harper regime.
Maybe the real question was the people involved 'reporting the news' or 'trying to make the news'? Maybe we don't know the facts??
France is accepting 30,000 Syrian refugees over two years. The column omits the 'over two years' part. That, by the way, is the same schedule the Harper government was on for Canada.
Stompin' Tom, the eminently philosophical bard once sang, 'if you don't think your country should come before yourself, then pick another country and go live somewhere else'. The USA has lots to offer. We will miss you. Good luck.
I am willing to bet that the other common factor is that they are all poor.
I believe you should investigate what Israel's own senior defense staff, both current and former, has said on the subject.
Quite so; having every computer imaginable connected to the internet is absurd.
Bud, these negotiators are lawyers... they always win. This problem will not go away until the 'revolution comes'. So to speak. In the sense of Douglas Adams' 'Hitchhikers' Guide To The Galaxy.'
This is a win for due process and the rule of law. It will also have implications for the new internet security bill now before the house, a bill that even those victimized by internet harrassment have misgivings about.
Liberals and BLM's are on the same side of the Frankfurt School. Of course they accommodate them, they put a face to their agenda.
three comments by me so far all censored as they took as shot at the liberals. I will be very happy when the Globe goes bankrupt.
Wait till the next bill.

Apparently Hides-in-Closet Steve confused the Stasi handbook with our constitution.
What an extraordinarily juvenile response.
Actually there are some employers that have an employee daycare service. I worked for one back Montreal back in the 70-80's. I personally do not have a problem with our PM, whatever party, receiving such assistance.
It's the Discovery Math generation ...
What a difference a day makes.
My take is if you single a group then its discrimination. But, if you do or don't invite everyone to dinner to your home then its fair game.

Most of our current pipeline system was built under that terrible right wing Liberal government wow use your brain, people need fuel reguardless of political view's.You would probably be the first crybaby if the power went out.
Tabitha, it wasn't just luck. You saved yourself with your strength and presence of mind. 'I managed to get up and run down the hill.' That was you, saving yourself. Take credit for it. I'm so glad you did.
Hey RR, you mentioned earlier that us emigrants don't want to pay taxes but want the benefits of citizenship. You never answered my question as to what we emigrants get.
Harper may have briefly shown some humanity but we have a very long list of his manipulation and contempt for Parliament. Nothing will change my opinion.
The result was 52% voted for none of them.
A blight on Canadian values as exemplified in our creation of a national park system.
They should be cleaning up our creeks and parks.....
You wrote 'Did you see the hourly wages being paid to the nannies? It's nothing.'It is - and that's a problem. Surely looking after children warrants a higher level of pay than that. Other than that, I agree with everything you wrote.
Bravo! This article is another attempt at the dying left to maintain the corrupt status quo.
That is not fair. Why should a scarf on one's head upset you so much? Do you dislike Nuns?
Read Gates' book.
King couldn't have done it without C.D. Howe. No matter what.
Are you really a geologist?
I haven't ever read any! Or do you mean by other columnists?
I think when we talk about immigrants we mean first generation immigrants.
The rest of Canada has bigger things to worry about than petty Ontario squabbles. Please get over yourself.
This is a very important article. As an old lefty, I get distressed by the anti vaccers on the left, and those opposed to all government regulation on the right.
Basic human rights like the Arab Spring. Freedom from dictatorships. Look where that led us to.
That has been shown over and over.
Someone got the surprise ending right. The hallmark of a good troll, though, is to leave the simpletons enough rope to hang themselves on.
Just bring some intelligent conversation, if you have any. Looks doubtful based on past experience.(BTW, I thought it was Harper was was responsible for the world price of oil?)
...must be a brainwashed liberal like the others and can't see the forest through the trees.
Glad to see you use 'Urban Dictionary' Instead of Webster... Oxford you know real ones... invent your words go ahead word worm
And since 9/11 it's been revealed that most people all over the world consider the US the worst threat to world peace. So, you're going to be boycotting the United States?

Cardboard is recalled less than wooden cribs, more breathable, a lot safer and more portable. That's awesome, I should have thought of that.
He is in full support of bringing Gibby back.
Elections for senators. That's the closest we can get to representation of the citizens. We could even experiment with oddball voting schemes.
Besides, I seriously doubt that Kovpak was a strong supporter of Hitler.
In coming decades Ontario will have fewer and fewer workers relative to dependents. More and more providers are not the answer. Allowing MDs to be productive IS the answer and Fee For Service does the job. As for 'value', ask the patients.
condolences to the family of rob ford.
There are lies, damn lies and statistics. Whoever did the poll didn't do it well.

It means you can ask the values questions, but the person answering might be lying. (Which begs the question: So what do we do? Ask the questions while the would-be immigrant is strspped to a lie detector machine? Nice waste of resources).
Yes, keep rubbing your monkey's paw and all your dreams will come true. Oh, my God. THAT'S NOT A PAW!!!! 
there's one less 'attractive' person than boneless liberal thinks...

Student success in math and science is inversely proportional to the extent of overmanagement by outside consultants and political charterists made welcome by the min/ed. This infiltration has impugned the professionalism of front-line teachers.
Betting that Canadians will be as bigotted as you, eh?
If and when Iran develops nuclear weapons, and does something really stupid like bombing Israel with nuclear bombs, then Israel, in retaliation, as per plan, will nuke Mecca and Medina, and that may well be the beginning of the end of Islam.
Of course every toxin has levels below which it's irrelevant to health. There's every indication, however, that this water system has been contaminated to levels that are very definitely hurting people.

You can quibble over a word if you like. All he is calling for is calmer heads.
Excellent article.
So far the Globe and all its writers have been 100% wrong about everything they have published about Trump. Why spoil a perfect record?
A must read for all the 'useful idiots' out there
The Harper PMO was among the first to condemn Flanagan. The Harper PMO - betraying Canadian values since 2006.
Maybe Brad cold use the tax rebated to the province to buy more buses. :)
Neither Mr. Trudeau or Mr. Mulcair would have made such as spectacle of themselves.
Exactly !The USSR and experiment with Communism is the ultimate ( bad ) example !
@bobvitalo: '20 years ago rape was rarely heard of in India '. You are correct. However, that doesn't mean it wasn't happening. You just didn't hear about it because it was kept under wraps.
Um... I think you need to take another look at the state of the British economy. They're not doing well. And the Greek economy is in a shambles because of precisely the kinds of policies that Maggie promoted.
It is highly unlikely that the author of the above piece has actually read Trump's statement on the matter, nor have most of the people denouncing Trump in the press. Granted, the world is easier to deal with simplistically.
Neither Bill Clinton or W. Bush went, did they? I believe W. hid in the Air National Guard.
Finally this time when the Hil and Bill are being outed as Republicans-Lite it is beginning to stick.
Canada cannot defend itself now.
Universities are not courts - they can't send you to jail, just expel you.
Christians always think other people are sinners. That gives them right to torture, snoop and persecute.
At one time I actually considered doing my master's at McGill... and would have had to deal with this idiot. Thank goodness I came to my senses and chose and American school. BTW you guys ever get your medical school accreditation back? lol
Well the same can be said of Canada. Are you willing to give up your home if a First Nations group makes a claim on your property? Didn't think so.
With Harper no problems were ever solved, so we will take our chances along with getting our Canada back.
Fair point, it wasn't technically a "coalition", but it operated as a de facto coalition for those two years.
I really hope we are not going to war. However, it is necessary to send Putin a message about the economic effects of any further transgressions.
Well said, I believe the line ' suck it up Princess ' would be appropriate in this case! Not sure if it's the Millennials faults, their parents or the manipulative educators who are to blame for this needy generation!
Agreed. Sadly it is taboo for men to follow their dreams if their dreams do not include working in a traditional role. Women at least have choices.
Sure. After all, now we've got Fantino in charge of Foreign Aid and Kent in charge of Environment.
Good points. Never saw it that way, but you're right.
Horvath lost me the minute she supported McGuinty and kept the Libs in power.
Have to agree with '...trailwalker...', and add that a flat tax will only work with a provincial goods and services sales tax along with the federal goods and services tax...
Go howl at something else...
So lets re-open all cases revolving European Interests in Canada - surely that same conflict has reared its ugly head a thousand fold.
Hi Al - kind of like Ontario, where the public sector is favoured to the detriment of the private sector. Thanks for clearing that up.
Maybe you could move to the US, live in a gated community and campaign for the Tea Party
I think merely writing and voicing an opinion on the situation pales in comparison to all the others trying to 'make a buck' off this event since that is not what is happening in this case.
.399 day campaign? Please, the Harper Tea Party Reformers don't govern, they campaign 24/7. Thus /so, this latest campaign started/began in 2011..
Freedom these days is an evasive thing: It keeps moving around and less and less people grasp it until it is gone entirely.
The I urge you to harness your disgust into helping the democratic party achieve the greatness it can achieve.
You mean that she won't keep her promises???
Heh, heh, heh!
Satellites do not measure temperature directly and there are questions about the adjustments and manipulations used to infer temperatures from their data. Any claims that they provide a gold standard are dubious.

Your right. It is hard to get along with liberals that way.
Only in your anxiety closet.

You would be surprised. A number of people read 'natural news' and various nutbar sites like mercola.

Does anyone actually read Tabitha's articles beyond the first paragraph?
By the way, Mr. Barry Wile, you shouldn't cut and paste from your own facebook site.
No matter where they put the tax it will be reflected in the price, but I agree it should be on the consumption end of things.
lagatta4: 'Fundamentalisms can exist in all religions. McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City was just as horrible as Al Qaida terror.' But you're missing the point -- McVeigh's motivation was anti-government, not religion. Poor example.
I suggest you travel to islamic countries and appreciate effects of Sharia on women and those who trust democracy will to speak your mind. Good luck with your open-minded judgment.
As manipulated by big business. Most effectual.

There's plenty of Pakistanis in Canada and I don't see this practice exercised here. Gee, I wonder why?

The big question is - how does the debate affect Trump's poll numbers in the GTA? Or has Clinton got enough votes already to win the GTA electoral college regardless of what Trump does?
Just waiting for the formality of an official endorsement before I end my subscription.
We're talking about the Ontario Liberals here... so definitely corruption is involved.
Trudeau is a sleaze.
To Aleighdo you have any objection to people paying for their own daycare disguised as kindergarten rather than have OTHER PEOPLE pay for it

I agree on all your points, JoyceW.
Except that nobody cares what Rona supports, or says. I don't believe they ever did. Nice hair though.

What do you mean "how much art is worth"? It's worth what the market will bear. And if piracy undermines the copyright owners ability to set a price, art becomes worthless.
In some European countries the gift-giving happens earlier in December and is separate from Christmas. There is a world of Christians outside of North America you know... This debate is so Anglo-centric.....
The police are Harper's private army...
First, I'd like to know where she came up with $100,000. I know a lot of firefighters, some who have been there for 20 plus years and never reached that salary, even as Captain.
I didn't know we had a stream media let alone a main one.
how about it is Time to Ignore Paul Heinbecker
'Natives have a right to their own way of living, thinking and feeling...'Perhaps, but when this or that 'way of thinking' leaves them in poverty, brutality, and misery, they've no right to complain as if it were somehow the fault of the rest of us.
Yes. This was a glaring error. Canadian campuses... heck Toronto-area campuses are up their ears in this.
The Harper govt is prone to shooting Canada in the foot.
Search the internet for Kal-Tec or Tavor TAR-21 or KRISS or Noringo 97.All currently available in Canada without a restricted license, all semi's, all 223 why all the fuss over the AR?
@Tom Gray Yes, that's what I said? There is no evidence currently that floods and hurricanes and such are changing as a result of global warming. Scientists do, nonetheless, predict it will at some point get worse.
The Doug and pony show have always maintained private $$$ will fund and finance new transit. Has any private $$$ come forward?
Apparatchik - "lesbian gay soapbox"? Seriously? Your arguments might be taken more seriously if you didn't feel the need to stoop to name-calling. Shameful!
Which is why you're still reading this eh Norton?
Well you know here in the Harpoon Buffoon govt we love to just skim and do things by our 'gut feel' cuz other approaches ....well ya know they are work and based of facts which we love to ignore.
NOT a negligible amount, but primarily so. That's already the case and will be that much moreso @ $10K/year. But don't let facts and logic get in the way of your silly mythology.
Wow. Absolutely excellent article.
Well put, Sea.
Shame shame shame on the taxpayer funded Harper/Ambrose trolls and their smearing of Hillary Clinton and for interfering in the US election. Shame shame shame on them all. Just more damage from the Harper years PM Trudeau will have to repair.
so that means humans can never affect climate? You are forming opinions based on emotion rather than evidence...
Oh there, there. Do not get all defensive over Harper. Of course they all do it, but he is our PM and just landed the biggest Canadian arms deal ever and it happened to be with the Saudis. Its a a very recent, prime example.
Look at his work online. He cares not a whit about suicide. He is just trying (and totally failing) to advance an anti-gun agenda.
I see the Globe has given this a byline and it is written by ELIZABETH RENZETTI. THis wasn't up when I posted - nicely written in any case.
We will have to start calling him Kim Il Stevie if he continues this isolationism .

Agreed on both points. Has anyone been able to figure out who wrote this editorial?
'What if they gave a war and nobody came?' No men. No women. Not even Americans!
Jack Canuck; Point taken.
Many mentioned the huge crucifix in the National Assembly, but forgot a white cross on the flag of Quebec. These crosses are everywhere in Quebec and should be handled by the Charter, do you hear me PQ.
Hardcore feminists tend to gravitate toward academia, special interest groups and generally as far away from the real world as possible.

Ur talking bull
And how did thar all work out?
Your inane comment certainly proves your point, Tormaine.
Joe, Joe, Joe... Try reading a newspaper or a book published outside Ontario my ignorant friend. Nobody cares about Mike Duffy west of Ontario - we just expect that kind of behaviour from the centre of our universe. BTW, have YOU tried crack?
'''OMG - a column from Wente that I agree with? Whodathunk!!'''More to the point: who cares?
if its a fund in Quebec y'all better check the balance- its likely been looted long ago
Yes but Montreal, St John's, Halifax and Calgary know who they are and don't care what other cities think .
How quickly people forget what working conditions were like before unions. FYI Canada was still a democratic society then...
How great of a high is that lead paint tainted weed though?
Nobody wants to date the old ladies, cougar culture is their only option, it's understandable why they're lonely.
Gilles will do much better in Quebec than most expect.
Conservatives aren't reforming the TFW program, they are backtracking on it after ballooning the program to over 500, 000 TFWs.
I'm rooting for Tory but am enjoying Ford taking it to Chow.
Absolutely Rob- we need to understand that no one has the right to tell you what you can do with your own body by imposing their belief system on you. Bravo!
thanks for the laugh!
Yeah, I mean look how they banned abortion and brought in school prayer and all of that far-right stuff.
No such thing as free trade.
well said. Just another Duffy with better table manners...................
Wow. So if you are unemployed and young and male you have to wear a video camera? Nice police state there. Why don't we just tattoo serial numbers on them too.
You should be writing the articles for the national press - this is absolutely true and so scary as we look at how the Canadian politics is being operated - and I agree, with the full support of the national press.
Ya, you're an Oracle. They've already started. And yes, many trained sycophantic monkeys have been elected into the Alberta legislature.
The Globe is making a big deal of this 'Putin confrontation'.. I would think a Globe reporter would have attempted to verify it, afterall it was reported by the PMO staff so crediblity is lacking... anybody out there who wants the truth?
There is no excuse for such uninformed commentary. Shameful.
The Leafs are doing very well as a business.... very successful. As a winning hockey team... they suck. But all in all... wouldn't you agree that hockey is the most important of the least important things?
The Australian 'Liberals' are pretty darn right-wing and Abbott was odiously so in the Harper vein.
'Michael Bell teaches at Carleton University.'=====So we know right away there is a whole range of truth foreclosed from this article.
Val, Dieter, Alex, Do you have to congratulate each other on this site? In all likelihood you are sitting beside each other in the basement of the Kremlin churning out this stuff. Just reach over and pat each other's backs.
Bavius - you should go back and reread Scrimbo's and Skoozerdooze's posts again.
In the end, Alberta PCs eat their own. Getty, Klein, Stelmach, and now Redford. Delightful!
Say what you will about the Trudeau announcement, it put the Harper government back on the defensive, took them off their message, and left them looking slow and uninspired on the whole Senate mess.
A recent Telephone Poll named Toronto the first, second, third and fourth most overrated city in Canada. Ya can't beat that!
Hate is not a healthy emotion.
Spot on....good luck in building your career and life. We need more of you.
That was my first thought. All that praying; empty air into empty space.
And despite all that even Jim knew that income splitting was bad for the nation. That should tell you something.
Fact remains that 30% of families with young children look after them at home. That is a significant number.
Harper is listening to the concerns of others. April Fool
It's not an improvement.
And of course your daughter would tell you what her friends said? Cool story bro.
Allan, your silence seems to condemn you.
Ifind your comments disturbingly stupid and hateful. How does supporting crooks and incompetents like Spence help the average band member get his roof fixed? HMMMMMMMMMMMM??????
And a happy holidays to you Margaret and to all the other climate deniers. Have a lovely green Christmas!
The problem is that sentence, whether the Globe and Mail editorial board realized it or not (and I strongly suspect not), is also a dog whistle for racists and bigots.
As usual, you have nothing substantial to say. Like him or not, Trudeau took a party from third place to a majority government. He isn't sitting in the basement taking cheap shots on the comments pages.
This is without doubt the silliest editorial I have read in a long, long time. Maggies little Bunnykins forces himself to use the word terror, and your response is tut-tut-tutting. What did you do in a previous life - push a pram?
$4 billion? Try $6-7 billion by the time it's done.
So much for that. Kingston and Ottawa warmed up late in the day and set clear records. But not Sudbury or North Bay.
'...I'll give you a big thumbs down for dreadful writing....'You are hoping for the unexpected...
I am not pointing fingers but it is hard to cast the Pakistanis as complete victims in the mess that constitute the India/Pakistani relations. Seems to me they both deserve a good share of the blame and condemnation.
Rob Ford was elected by people who are tired of being the dumbest person in the room.
Are you trying to say that no Francphone died during the World and the Korean War?
Reading this article I can't help but think that the author has completely confused the term 'populist' to mean 'pro-European Union'.
Yeah, unfortunately the victims were not following your advice....! Ha !
Junius, you are an idiot for paying for the Globe.
And so long as we're being forced to pay for it.Cons seem to have a $30K limit when it comes to paying for their own things out of their own pockets.
Very good. Howard Levitt at the National Post gives Jian ZERO chance of recouping his position and no money. It's all about the brand. Where is Max Clifford when a celebrity needs to solve a problem ?
it's called coming and going
I always find it funny when liberals, who invented bitter, angry, and small-minded now accuse others of this.....
Some cancers will be triggered to grow rapidly and out of control if they aren't completely removed.

Yes, the richests of the world want to turn nations into media controlled pulp, an army of brainless Borgs which follows commands, so it's easier to sell us stuff. Imagine the whole world eating at McDonalds, buying Nikke etc..
Yes, I hope they do. We need a revolution against this globalization nightmare: the true enemy of diversity.
But has it had serious, lasting effects on your brain?
Nation-building in Iraq actually isn't over yet. By the way: ISIS still hasn't taken Baghdad.
Good for you !!!
Yes, a diversionary tactic that most here seem to approve of.
And yet you come here and read her? Good grief. You know what? Just because you don't like it don't mean it ain't no good.
Kinda sucks that Harper wasn't more open with the media to get free coverage during his time in government? So he preferred to splurge the taxpayers' dime on paid ads instead.
Oh sure, lets bend down and kiss the muslim arabs feet and then give them all B J's
After one sentence I knew I'd see it ... and a little later, sure enough, there it is: 'you lefties.' That's when I stopped reading.

They need to stop the Investigation going on right now, as soon as they pass this Bill, the Investigations are over. What suckers we Canadians are....
This media outlet has abandoned all but the pretense of journalism. In reality it works 24/7 for the HarpoCult against Canada.
Freedom, why do you rant here? You don't convince anyone with these cheap, repetitive, pop-gun rants. They are silly. Stop doing them.
We do need another system for sure, im all for a new system that dont involve a senate or govener general and has no unions. What do you think:)?
What analysis? He speculates without presenting any 'real evidence'. Tansey's simply adding to the evidence that UBC has a dysfunctional culture.
Totally agree. Aggression from the west hasn't worked. The IS is not our problem. Let wealthy Muslim countries deal with it.
This was always much bigger news in Toronto and Montreal where they don't grow wheat than on the prairies. No need to explain why.
It is perfectly legitimate for the Liberals to adopt a pro-choice position as part of their party platform. Does anyone really think Trudeau is proposing 3rd trimester abortion on demand?
What an excellent idea. The information in Mr. Mitchell's column should be widely distributed on different media.
A carbon tax on everything! Courtesy of Harper Government. Another thing he failed to mention in his 'barnburner' of a speech to his faithful in Calgary South West aka Camelot.
You say there is a 'groundswell of popular support in Canada.' Sorry, ain't happening and ain't gonna happen. A lot of those Scandanavians are in real trouble and they know it. Ghettos for decades - until new ones are built.
UK Daily Mail, NY Daily News, 'Faux' News... Mainstream? Certainly. Fact-based and credible? Nice try.
I think you're wrong about that
In other words... a woman, right?
Like it is'If you break a law then you get punished.' Not if the law is the Charter. There is no penalty for violating the Charter.
It is time for Harper, Kenney, Moore and lets not forget Poilievre To leave the government... they just do not believe in democracy Please people vote them out of office.
Bayne didn't earn a nickel - pro bono because he figured Duffy was badly treated.
They can be conservative in their bent without being sycophsnts, toadies or blind. There's a difference. One would hope.
Very well said, thanks
Fellas, the auditor general's report was comprehensive, well-researched, and very telling. Some anonymous anecdotes on the internet about other equally anonymous people--not so much.
Pathetic that you try to score political points off this tragic photo. Awful.
Harpo only has a book to get his morals from. Normal people have a sense of right and wrong, They don't need a book to tell them what to do.
Greed and laziness of the downloaded-thieves.
I think they'll be voting for you to leave.
no need for it.
Mandatory random urine testing for steroid abuse wouldn't hurt either.
She's a puppet!
Andy, throwing a banana at a player insinuates that he is a monkey because of his race. Go back to your country has nothing to do with race. Was it a dbag statement? Yes. Racist? No.
After the Trump Presidency all those that are hard on Obama ...will eat their words and will have egg on their face. Just a matter of time. Obama was one of the great American Presidents....period!
The Globe and Mail represents first and foremost the business interests of Canada, and they have given the CPC a free ride since 2006. You know that Harper is in big trouble when even they criticize him!
What a hopelessly vacuous collection of platitudes! I hope the Globe did not pay by the word for this empty rhetoric.
I don't know if you missed it but unlike with the previous fighting with Al Queda where it appeared that the Arab states were on the sidelines, both Saudi Arabia and UAE have sent fighters for the bombings of ISIS.
Der Bingle writes: 'he outright stated that he had no idea what could be done on Syria'==============Anyone who claims that they know what can be done in Syria is either a liar or a fool. In this case at least Harper is neither.
So why should you vote.....if you decide to return to live here you can vote again.
Only in 2006, 2008 and 2011. Maybe they'll stopby 2015 ?
Sounds a lot like Russia and China as well.
Hi Skitty, since CBC is a federally regulated employer, they fall under the Canada Labour Code; not Ontario Employment Standards.
'There was never a Jewish ISIS'It's called Likud. True, they don't send suicide bombers; it is far safer to slaughter from the comfort of US-supplied F18's and Apache gunships.
Should we de-legalize everything you can't do right son?
What a load of hogwash!
It will now.
The first route was a non-starter, going right over the biggest aquifer in the water-parched American mid-West.
Seems to have been a lot of push back in the past few decades, they cant do this, they cant do that. Feed them pablum and they'll stay babies until age 30.
There was a time when slavery was upheld by a majority as a norm. Women's right to vote as well. And how exactly am I forcing my "values" (a clear attempt to mock me through punctuation) on anyone? Human rights should not be arbitrary.
Using extreme examples of bullying to justify what we are talking about is pretty lame.
You can't prove either exists and you can't prove either doesn't exist. Both require "faith" in the absence of any evidence.
Very well, we defeated Harper. Didn't you follow the election?
Of course - nice example. As I myself have said elsewhere, where are all the lawsuits against employers and unions? They would be a guaranteed win in any Canadian court. And yet... nothing.
You know full well what I meant. Would you like a tissue to go with my adjectives?
no you are wrong. Marijuana is weed, it can grow fine all over Canada in the summer at which time it can be concentrated into pollen, pure hash and kept for a long time without losing potency.
Wow! Strong stuff guys! I am getting the vicarious buzz from you already!
93% ... really ? Who knew ? Have been to the far outer reaches of space so know the extent of space ? Wow, arrogant humans again. Climate change one day, this the next.
Blank you.
Bob Rae declared he would spend his way out of the recession and increased the annual government deficit by 10 Billion. Ontario's credit rating was dropped and interest charges increased. Taxes were increased too.
The voters of Toronto rejected the Left. The wisdom of their choice is obvious. Look at what the Left did to Detroit.
Dr. Oz should have his medical licence revoked!!! He preaches easy quick-fix solutions to people who don't know any better. Absolute garbage.
m.o.p. = member of parliament? That's federal, Notley's NDP serve in the legislature of Alberta and are MLAs. You might want to brush up on that before assuming they will just sit and spin in the province as Harper does federally.
I certainly hope so! I for one do not want to occupy a bed and caregivers once my mind is gone, while causing distress to my family, for no gain on my part.
Jeffrey never met a Liberal Party policy he didn't like. Seriously globe, time to put this anachronism out to pasture.
I don't think hitting yourself on the head with a hammer counts but it might explain the hairdo.
You mean she is listening to the people? Shame on her!
You have never vote Conservative in your life.
..... like lobbyists .....
Since the payment of those taxes to the American Auto producers leaves less money to pave roads, employ doctors, and build sewers its very likely that if it continues you won't be able to continue enjoying those things.
there really should be a button where you can just report stupidity.....
Well Shema, it's a free country, not a Muslim country. It works both ways. We have freedom of speech here and that includes freedom to criticize. Educate yourself about western law.
Poor Omar, the white sheep in a black family, innocently following dads footsteps in the al queda family business..
Its amazing they're still using that word! Stumbled?
If wynne and Horvath had the guts to call an election today, Hudak and Douggie are elected. In two years Hudak ousted and Doug premier. Not that improbable. Sorry guys, I can hear your high pitched screaming in cabbagetown already.
GE, I agree ! Why they we elect this lying liberal government 3 times in a row ?
Yet they were still listening to him though? They signed onto Harper's war to help did they not? So they must be listening to him.
Finally... finally...finally...the voice of reason. Thankyou. The rest of you can go home now.
Who is 'the haven't'?
Was that a joke? How is limiting a class to white, heterosexual authors helping minds grow in scope and power?
Helloooooo Robert.
the liberal party has been and continue to be the most corrupt political party in Canada.
Get over it. Your hyperbole is tiring.
The fact they run the ad in theaters makes it irrelevant. The people are not driving they are in a theater . Why would they expect something like that to happen.
Wow , it's got to be a sad day for Canada when this gov't's 'raison d'etre' is terror. When terrorism becomes you best friend , then we all loseDr Mike Popovich
There is no aura of power, there only is irresponsible self-indulgence, if you serve the public and abuse taxpayer funded money, perks and responsibility.
It's hard to believe that we have such thick eegits running the country. It must be the Alberta water or something
To paraphrase - The things we do in haste we live to repent in leisure.
The whole 'prayer room' in offices and businesses are absolutely ridiculous. Go to your church or mosque or pray at home.
Go back to grade 5 and learn some Canadian History sonny. Do some research before commenting and revealing how ignorant you are of Canada's contributions since 1950.
Ann Coulter was not banned from speaking at University of Ottawa. Her organizer Ezra Levant cancelled it.
The U of T harbours some princely provocateurs these days. This one's a bomb-shelter throwback.
Its popular because everyone knows if you want to get a fed govt job you need to speak french.
You really don't understand the difference between spin and suppression do you, JM.
disgraceful and heartbreaking
You can guarantee that when politicians are involved there will be theatre.
the countries that defeated Communism in Europe were largely social democrats, along with the US
Nope, of all the people posting on this thread, only carbonnetnote, frillzz, WestTeal are the same person. Lots of people don't like environmentalists . . . but don't promote police state actions.
an interesting statement. It will get people to think- WOW
Do you also print this in an understandable version?
All of them, regardless of political affiliation.
The Toronto Star ran an uncensored Charlie Hebdo cartoon with its weekend editorial. The National Post has run a mix of some cropped or censored versions, and a couple of complete ones.
"Unlike you, we're intelligent enough to know that what we do in Canada is irrelevant" A classic denier talking point.
criminal? seriously? It is a opinion-piece. And you know what they say about opinions - everyone is entitles to one.
Thank you Elizabeth. You said what I wanted to say, in such a beautiful way.
Why is it s important to have one word?
Then, David, you sponsor a complete family yourself. Take them into your home and support them financially. What's stopping you?
Thus spake the unbiased clot.
you have obviously missed the big picture.
A Harper Hater's worst night-mare come true. The ROC rally's to the Conservative side, Quebec stays in Canada. Almost unbearable to contemplate!!! Enjoy.
Nice pun Joe! I assume you mean stop fracking the sedimentary rock layers in search of oil and gas potentially, contaminating the water table?
well said... my sentiments exactly
Your grandfather, IMHO, is an perfect illustration of what being a man really is. Many confuse education with formal schooling. They're not necessarily the same.
no Chinese either--but four Sikhs.
Of course the Bay Street Boys must be able to participate actively in the political process, their opinion, enlightenened by commercial practices, are a god- given gift to the Canadian democracy. Quebec does not have that chance.
So its a bit cloudy in January in some places. OK let just keep destroying the planet then.
Doug is not a "leftist"? oh I see he is a "progressive", ashamed to be called "leftist" one of those I see
Keep believing the hype Mark.
Most comments show that lots of Canadian must agree With Putin annexion of Crimea. Unfortunately for some you, we have no intention for most of us in quebec of leaving a country we work hard building the democratic institutions and way of life
Mikey. we know you . You are a CONservative... be gone
To cut roots of terrorism, enforce the Rule of Law
Everything, probably.
In addition, over 70% of the people in other surveys defines more as less 10,000 refugees. They also attach the caveat of complete security clearance PRIOR to entering Canada.
you are the 1%
I agree, or we have elections every 2 years. It seems once your in 'power' your actions or inactions don't matter because you have been 'elected' by the people.
Harpers gone man. We're onto the next incompetent political mess. Get with the times.
Ahhh, the stereotype threat, trying hard not to be an oxymoron or self fulfilling prophecy or something like that.
Wynne is a shame to the human race.
Effort is always essential, but effort is on a continuum. Some people have to go into overdrive to do well. For others, not so much is required.
We have to trust the younger Murdoch men will not be employing him.
Great idea. This would be consistent with the UN Human Rights strategy.
How about eCigarettes?
Selling the Wheat Board to the Saudis, sell arms to the Saudis, then run around whining about radical islamism?
Your environment is king!
Great comment
Private excess only exist because of government policy that enables it.
Funny how putting out facts becomes 'stupid' as opposed to adamant conjecture.
When you have experienced the anguish then you will have a different experience of the issue believe me.
And my tablet turns the word "sex" into "decision" for some reason. Caught it later a few times.

Why stand up for rights and freedoms of immigrant applicants when same stand does not occur for Canadian citizens?
Well, your ideas are a one way ticket to privatized care my dear friend.
@ Middle CanadaCompared to nearby American cities Toronto isn't too shabby as far as unemployment is concerned. Detroit 9.9% Buffalo 8.5% Chicago 9.5%. I bet the mayors of these cities would love to exchange their problems for Toronto's.
No mention of Trudeau Foundation, Chinese Billionaires, pay for play... this is the same old biased left wing media game that Americans saw through ...protecting Hillary, without shame...
The haters of modernity strike at women in a women hating paternalistic nightmare environment. Persia was more advanced than these stuck in the Middle Ages boring, sick, men.
The video of Alton Sterling shows him quite clearly being shot point blank in the chest.
ICAO is a huge point of pride in Mtrl. If it leaves this will not be forgotten or forgiven for a very, very long time.
Thanks for coming out Jeff. A provincial sales tax is not needed nor wanted in Alberta. Its every socialists pipe dream though.
Wente nailed itJT or Muclair will not win this next election. Harper has already lost it.
That doesn't make them wrong though does it?
First two sentences are nonsense, but there it is accurate to say that as a group being persecuted by ISIL Christians should get preference because their lives are directly in danger.
It is particularly funny since Lawrence Martin is usually a Liberal hack.
And here it now is in all its ridiculousness.
So what ethical rule are you using here? Which ethical system enjoins people to commit suicide out of altruism?
... Or perhaps the G&M editorial board wishes to send some of their money to the indebted countries?
So apparently the G&M has just put up an article that states Canada must be prepared to walk away from the table regarding any new negotiations of NAFTA. Canada must be reading Trump's 'The Art of the Deal' book.
... still angry reading the truth, to bad.
OK, curious now. Yes, you got me. Care to elaborate?
That is not what is at issue here.
A tough decision. Which jerk is the worst?
Good article, Mr. Martin. War is a crime committed on the young and the innocent. The UN should pass a resolution that the minimum age for military service should be 55. That might stop war.
With a comment like that I doubt LC has any ability to reason.
And what do you figure Wente's contribution toward solving that problem is? I mean, other than actively trying to shame those that are trying.
Um, this life sounds awesome. How do you find houses to sit for internationally? Good luck with your historical novel. That Giller is right around the corner.
jimmieilyssa, you rant about lefties, but you don't refute a single comment that Mr McClure made.
you do realize the cpc is going to ride this issue and a balanced budget to another majority in 2015 don't you? Perhaps you should grow-up and realize there is only 1 party in Canada that is capable of running this country at this point in time.
How long did it take you to figure that out ?
SO what???? The selfie dork screamed at the opposition for fundingthe rich like himself.
Nothing has been settled... the SCOC struck down Canada's abortion law in 1988 with the suggestion parliamentarians enact a law... they haven't...we've a lawless society... nothing is settled.
All this from Captain Accountability.
If you wait for the Europussies, you'll be waiting forever. They need the US to fight their fights.
Referendums didn't work out so well in California.
Oh, gawd - did you ever think anyone would still be spouting that ridiculous, 'I hate the sin, not the sinner' crap? You KILL me, Bellboy - better get back to the front desk.
Unions are not necessary^ Okay, then we will take away: * Your weekend break (someone fought for this) * And maternity leave (yes, someone fought for this) * And sick leave (yes, someone for this).
Creative Thinker ... you are not! Inuendos and guesses are what you offer as an intelligent and fact based arguments. Please, discuss issues you know and understand. For starters, you obviously do not know anything about refining Syncrude bitumen!
More and more women are getting into games every year.
The Globe has really become a husk of what it once was. Stale leavings from BHL? Seriously? Yeah, I'm going to pay for that.
shiftless2 The example where the parents take charge might. That would probably have the same affect as denial. Incidentally, people commit suicide because they have issues that they are unable to resolve in their own minds where it really counts.
NOthought8: 30 AM on April 16, 2013What gives you your credentials to contradict him?----------...'Stephen Harper is a role model'?...to who?...so far Steeve's proven, a lying, incompetent,CHEAT!...with the records to prove it eh?!...
Their opinion is as valid as yours which makes for a fair society.
It's obvious from your poor spelling and reading comprehension of the article that you went to a public school
I'd be very careful saying what you are saying. Posting on a public forum doesn't insulate you from slander.
Don't know why anybody is disagreeing with you, Sporty. Perhaps we Canadians can't handle the truth, which I guess would be consistent with why it is we've supported these lying dogs in the first place.
JUSTIN is going to support his billso by opposing Harper you oppose also Justinouch !
'Arctic air is sweeping across Canada'??? Out here near the wet coast OF CANADA the temperature is well above zero and the rain is falling gently. Toronto-centric much, Ms. Wente?
Absolute nonsense, and you believed him? http://coat.ncf.ca/mideast/WikiLeaksIraq.htm http://www.globalresearch.ca/canada-s-secret-war-in-iraq/8110
it does not seem that teachers are trusted or respected
I haven't watched Stewart is years. He isn't funny anymore. His shtick is repetitive and one-sided. Plus he's such a hypocrite. I give him credit though - He did make millions though from the lemming left.
So cutting all the top and best employees will lead to better healthcare? Moot anyways since labor laws wouldn't allow it.
This may or not help: a gluten free diet.
It was at the behest of Nixon who wanted a back channel to Mao.
5,000 years is not a geological time frame. It is a very human time frame though well beyond an individual's time frame.
Are you saying that Harper and MacKay were intending to buy Super Hornets all along?!
Sort of like how everyone who disagrees with you is stupid and wrong!
I have to be careful not to disparage a practice that allows a man to divorce by uttering some word 3 times? Even by phone or text? What are you smoking?
Congratulations to Brad Wall. He listens to people & is therefore smarter than the entire Liberal cabinet. Good work Brad.
She didn't conclude that he was guilty. Read the whole article next time.
You probably salivate over Tabatha Southey too. Are you old enough to remember when newspapers employed people who reported the news?
Well put. Agreed.
These technologies are tools. The way they are used depends on the user. Many people use them for good purposes with no ill effect.
The saying in the horse industry is breed the best to the best and hope for the best. Do you concur?
I wonder what Connor McDavid thinks about that?
Some funny shots. While working at 1 St. Clair Ave west during the summer of 75 there was one lane west on the 401 to get out of town. That was ugly.
Unions have replaced the middle class with overpaid thugs. What little real middle class that is left won't last long unless the government can take control back from the collective.
Your premise that oil production is unethical is what's wrong with your argument.
A useful site for a different perspective on climate change http://icecap.us/
stupid man. Not much more to say about has beens Ford & Ford. Let's move on. Stop talking about him and stupid bother. Move onto positive events like the Dufour-Lapointe kids who are deserving.
Actually the nefarious deeds of the NSA are as old as the Cold War - remember that ??None of this is actually 'news' except for the MSM asleep at the switch !
I stopped reading after, 'Our entire country should ...'
Deal with it. I'm tired of watching you guys lie to both to yourselves and the rest of us on a daily basis.
This sounds like a high school essay. Lots of platitudes and no substance.
Yes CR. Privatize profits and socialize losses - the fascist mantra.
I am not sure who is poorly treated, is it by the state or their own leaders. Having been to a few reserves and dealing with chiefs it seems somehow, a lot of money going only to a few people while the community lives in poverty
my thoughts exactly!
Excellent spiel Rob!
Did you say 'pretty'?
No, people like you gave us Rob Ford.
.More petulant commentary from yet another, um, 'academic chair-human', umm, 'intellectual'....
It's very interesting to read some of these comments. I hope other Canadians have a better grasp of the issues than these Globe and Mail readers.
mathieus....another dream palace, professional victim. I'd like to call everyone Canadian....but that seems to be unacceptable ...especially to the chiefs
His handlers dropped the ball. From now on, Prime Minister Elbow is getting daily reminders to not act out.
Harper was an untried newbie himself at the start, benefited from the balanced budget and low debt inherited from Chretien and Martin, and has basically squandered that advantage. Not exactly evidence of great management of the economy.
Agreed. Harper and team Con have added little (national debt not included) and subtracted much from this nation in their time as government.
Millions of Jews most certainly do NOT go to Israel, and quite a few Israelis try to leave as well. That analogy doesn't work.
Are you a member of the Ice Tea Party?
So the world's scientific experts are all part of an 'elite' conspiracy? Complete Rubbish. Take the tin hat off, read some real science and stop watching Sun Media or Fox 'News'
Christians just can't resist martyrdom.. financial or otherwise.
Margaret, you might want to ponder the following view of where Europe is headed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w6-YCq9BO4
and this matters, why?
Brian 12127Great. Let them pay what it actually costs to get them there!
We should just leave the corrupt UN completely . It's not the cost of the desertification panel, it is that it is a useless marxist gab fest that will only arrive at one solution. The West must pay. Bail.
btw universities don't arrest people - the police do that. what planet is Regent College on?
And I forgot to mention one more thing. It is as Christopher Hitchens said: drinking makes other people seem less boring!
can..........but wontthat is the problem
may be because Vietnamese people won?
I am from BC. I have no idea what you are talking about.
You have no idea how bad it was under the NDP and how much Wall has changed the attitude in SK.
Well said Margaret. The most intolerant these days are the left, who have no room at all to nudge their already made-up minds.
What's your idea?
Do AGW zealots get paid by the word or by the convert? Perhaps its by the number of peers reviewing their publications? Inquiring minds.
Racists exist everywhere, but the Western world has proven to be the most open and welcoming. Let me know when the ME, Africa, and many Asian countries become more welcoming before you throw stones.
BCH - You are the first person to raise a key factor. Storage. Since we cannot effectively store electricity we must use it when it is produced. This whole issue is conveniently overlooked by the advocates.
I recommend Bart D. Ehrman's book How Jesus Became God and Reza Aslan's Zealot... fascinating reads.
Congratulations on your cynicism, but frankly I don't see as reason to feel self-righteous about it.
Yet wear a Star of David on campus and see how how far this 'sensitivity' goes. California is especially a hotbed for hatred http://www.algemeiner.com/2016/09/08/uc-berkeley-offers-a-class-in-erasing-jews-from-israel-and-destroying-the-jewish-state/
We have heard this idealistic nonsense before but if you really believe this then get you and the other 7 billion people on the planet to start working individually on this problem.
Bill Cosby springs to mind .... just for starters.
Sadly yes - the Nomenklatura effect in full view. Regrettably the sheeple think it exists for their nanny state benefit ..... NOT !
You just pretending the +$150 billion in debt Harper rang up doesn't exist then, since you're probably OK with someone else's kids paying the bill?
Thank you, Ms. Pinker. My biggest beef with Facebook is that it is such an informal way of communicating with others.
Oh boy - I'm laughing out loud at the idea that naturopathic training involves 'hard science'. Priceless!
So, you supported the overthrow of Gadhafi? You must be so proud of what's happened to Libya, which is far worse off now than it was before Gadhafi was overthrown. If Israel had a hand in that, then the rise of ISIS is partly its fault.
Actually, I feel like it's going more like North Korea since 1950. I'm sure there's a family of leaders Mr. Harper can respect and has learned from.
Mark advocates the Venezuela solution. More socialism. They are starving down there, in the land of the socialist dream.
We're importing both; no immigration policy in the world can separate the two. The Boston Bombers are an easy example of that.
Are you implying that Obama, even with his many failings, is a Socialist? Explain.
Wheras there is no industry at all where somebody can make money by being a contraraian to accepted wisdom on health care? You clicked on here, right?
Is that spelled Duke or Dick?
I find it rather interesting to note that Ms Wolf still paints her face to try to look more appealing to succeed.
As DT would say; Wrong
While 'honourable' MPs are highly regarded for their service, there is an obvious undercurrent of ego, selfish ambition and outright greed. This article basically tells the former to keep the latter in check.
We haven't had that big earthquake yet. And the proposed new KM isn't a 'twinning' as for the most part it's taking a different route. More PR BS.
Or part of a necessary response to murderous nutters.
This isn't as bad as I expected it would be, but this isn't the time for it. I'd rather read 'Alexander offers to meet with Trudeau team to share lessons learned.'
Of course, if Trump wins, one of the first things he will probably do is crow about how fair and just the system is!! It's only 'rigged' if things don't go YOUR way, right, Donald?
I never like the 'give 'em a try' rationale. What is their plan? Is it credible? Will they promise and then be forced to accommodate their base?
Solutions Inc - that sounds very CIA. Before you get all up in my face about tinfoil hats, etc. let me just assure you I was only half serious. I'm sure Moore, Garry R is just a crank.
Let's see if he sits , kneels or does handstands today... on the 9/11, during the anthem and flag raising?
Anyone watching the debate would realize Clinton won. I fact anyone who would support Trump after watching him must be a f#$%g idiot. The man cannot be given the keys to the nukes.
Miss Trump? Yes, as often as possible.
Done! Bye bye Linda.
We should be training our own doctors if we need them, not stealing them from poor countries.
True, but he has at least 8 thumbs-down from dummies. I hate Putin, but I'm not as dumb as the dummies.
He ran again twice and was defeated both times.
It's all about his appointment - which was unconstitutional; Harper knew it; was advised of it but he still did it. That's why Duffy was worried about reporters digging around for more information.
Reading the article, I got the feeling that I'm sure I've read this somwhere before...
Ever heard of freedom of the press? People like you are the real threat to our freedoms.
Try to get out more, 1chawk. http://globalnews.ca/news/3045796/80-of-canadians-fear-a-donald-trump-presidency-poll/ http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/08/05/russia-putin-held-in-low-regard-around-the-world/

A PRAYER FOR ATHEISTSMay atheists be tolerant and not hate People of ReligionMay atheists preach tolerance and practise itMay atheists love People of Religion who love atheistsAmen
Can we at least keep their Bell Center steamies, Montreal Smoked Meat, and maybe one ski hill in the Laurentians?
A foolish and not well thought out rant you mean. Observe the rise of Hitler and you will see Trump in lock step.
That's what she got hired to do, so she has to keep finding another angle to flog to keep her career going.
What 'restraint' is Jeffrey talking about? I don't see much restraint. Maybe wishful thinking. There seems to be a lot of that in the budget.
That's your story - keep telling to to yourself. The rest of us understand we've just elected the Liberals to another majority. What is they have to do to get us to vote for them?
Cameron is a snotty, jumped up little fascist who seems intent on quashing dissent and democracy. The second amendment in the U.S. Constitution begins to look more prescient all the time.
Fred - you deleted your comment! Good call.
listen to Tory you will not win any sympathizers to your cause only drive more to Uber. Last I checked the consumer has a right to decide where to spend their money.
Huh? The student didn't want to complete the curriculum required in the course? How does that effect your rights? Your rights don't include changing state rules and requirements to appease every hair brained religious belief.
How about just 'misunderstood' instead of terrorist? Would that make you happy?
If Canada is such a bad place why so many people are waiting to come in.
"The challenge for Canadians isn't the economy it's taxation due to out of control entitled labour cost." Is this your own gibberish, or does it come from talking points?
Excellent point, presumably all the dippers currently in the party believe what the preamble states and therefore would be honor bound to resign if this most basic premise of their party were to be eliminated.
Exactly what respect is this little creep due?
Nice try con troll
Garry Filmon did it briefly but of course the free spending NDP got back in...
Western woods: Moimeme was commenting on the report itself. And that is exactly what it says.
Overcome by right of centre media? Spend some time on the CBC web pages having your legitimate right of centre comments 'disabled' and indulge in a few 'balanced' articles in the Star. That will reset your moral compass.
So if we buy Tilley hats, we will be safe wherever we go in the world. Well, that eases my mind. I'm sure the G&M editors will be glad to be able to put that in their next editorial excoriating the PM.
this is one big mess that Canadians will be paying the price for years, trudeau has not got a clue on how to solve this migration, we don't have a lot of housing at the best of times.
But dirty tricks ARE ok...In Stephen Harper's politics. Dirty tricks hand book authored by a dirty PM. His hands are so dirty, I'd refuse to shake it.
Good to point out that this populist/strongman trend is not restricted to the USA. I hope that we can continue to resist it in Canada. Unfortunately I feel your analysis of the issues and consequences that Clinton would face is pretty spot on.
It is a good thing that Harper and his miserable reformcon party are not widely known abroad. The common people in the foreign countries still believe that all Canadians are nice people.
Unlike Justin Trudeau's personal standards that involve calling a minister of government a 'piece of sh*t'.Yes, nice leader you have there.
.. better than Canada which doesn't even bother to try ......
Tony, how u feel about the ontario liberals. Interested in your point of view. Do u think they are more corrupt than Harper?
Agreed! My brain hurts.
I think the evidence is that it's a vicious circle and so it is both. Recent evidence shows that the poor are the ones MOST likely to marry, and then also to divorce. In other words, they were already poor, and then thought it was wise to marry.
Oh LaLa! You have such insight into my deep desires. Hahahahaha! Based on so many of your comments, it is not I who is obsessed by her or for that matter, her wardrobe. Have a good day doing whatever it is you do.
Because anarchy is so very accountable ...
Where is your evidence this is "one small violent sect"?
Art, One man's job is another man's pain in the butt. But even worse one man's productivity is another man's place in line at the food bank.
not quite true, in Iceland they do often bring in extra workers for the height of the fishing season but they are paid the same as the local workers
Hey Concerned - better look into your WWII history before you start calling OTHERS foolish. It was 6 million Jews and 5 million others, including the Roma, for starts. And frog march? 3 years? Jumpin Jeebuz.
don't want to spend my tax money on paying refugees at least immigrants contribute to the economy and create taxjust put a good filter who and what immigrant to take
Since Ajay6's comment is to be deleted, why publish it---and the answer to this question must also suffice as an answer to said Ajay6's original question---even if it too is meant to be deleted.
Finally. A G&M writer who knows something about this matter. Intelligent truth is always good to hear when a problem is in discussion. You won't hear it from many Indian chiefs nor many Canadian politicians.
Like the accountability act that showed the excess salaries and waste of many native chiefs and councils. Justin repealed that so it is all nicely hidden away. Way to undo the damage.
It was in this instance.
"without a trace"? Are you really that ignorant? Not one penny is unaccounted for.
Hangdog forget the article for a second. The media you quote are often suspect as well. But the fact that this is a logical opportunity for ISIS and other radical jihadists is undeniable
I certainly hope so. It's a scandal, if you ask me.
They closed the comments on the attack in Turkey.
Have you seen Dearborne Michigan?
That will come as a serious surprise to Merkel.
You think gangsta is cool? Bad attitude, plus stu pid.
A lot of people are popular... until you actually get to know them. Once Trudeau actually does a couple of terms in Parliament and shows who he is, his popularity will plummet to real world lows...
Ethics aside - this begs the question of do we want the news/reporting performed by knowledgeable insiders or entirely clueless but unbiased 'reporters' who think nuclear power stations glow in the dark ......
'If the media is the message...'No.If the MEDIUM is the message...
Get out while the gittin is good...
A very well written response - Unexpected from the G&M posters. Grad student or Professor?
Once in a while the G&M editors get it right. This is one of them. Perhaps we should be thankful for small mercies.
We'll let you know when you can leave your bunker.
It would have been political suicide for the NDP to have supported Harper in 2015. No NDP leader would have been that stupid.
Bottom line: BC is different from Alberta. People in BC, especially Aboriginal communities, treasure their natural areas and will gauge the value of development carefully. Albertans will never say no to any development, EVER.
It's a child... not a choice.
A good beginning would be for the author of this piece to stop looking like she just stepped of the 11:15 flight from Karachi.
I am so proud of my country and of my Prime Minister. It feels so good to get that feeling back again, after 10 years of hanging my head over the Conservatives policies. Canada is back !
Now try a diamond spoon and some 40 pound test line. LOL. Well trolled.
Love people who really know what has been 'clearly meant'. Wonder what is your interpretation of the First Amendment that talks about 'the right of people peacefully to assemble'. Or, definition of 'people' changes based on your preferences?
If nobody has been charged, maybe it's because there are no credible charges to lay? Besides, the RCMP somehow thought that Nigel Wright wasn't guilty of offering a bribe but Duffy was guilty of accepting the same GD money as a bribe.
The dead hand of government is not much concerned about efficiency, effectiveness or outcomes. Like all entitlement-rich civil service environments healthcare's first priority is the providers' economic and social well-being.
Torstar's editorial board is on crack, the rest of the dailys will get their endorsements right
Great article, bang on. When I hear Trudeau speak about immigration I get nervous because it sounds like he wants to undo the process you describe above. Let's hope his comments don't mean what I think they mean and we stay to course.
Or, increased use of robots will dictate a more educated workforce. Perhaps this time with more employees in trades rather than obtaining advanced degrees.
areyoukidding me: Yeah, but if we ignore the idi ots they'll just turn THAT into something to feel victimized by the elites over.
Bravo. Let tolerance, equity and freedom be our passwords, and let them trump fear and hatred.
Great response, Joe!
Perhaps, before people are given citizenship in Canada, there should be a document signed saying that children born in Canada must stay in Canada. actually Jan
Orwellian Truthspeak ..!.
1. Yes 2. Yes 3. Yes
The world is trending and bending right ... I would not be surprised to see Marine Le Pen do very well next May. Odds increase exponentially if there is yet another act of terror within Frances borders between then and now.
Most inmates do NOT have lawyers at their parole hearings . they can't afford to pay even minimal fees, and Legal Aid across the country does not pay for parole hearings. just another ill-informed, cynical comment, Mr Laffer.
In other words it's all the arabs fault. Isreal bears no responsibility for the suffering of the palestinians.
More of a newspaper fellow, but has he interviewed Ms Clinton yet?
Why is Harper trying to suppress the the young University vote in his fair elections act?
'That is a public-policy cancer that requires immediate treatment.'Great closing line!
Support the poor for all their needs. Let the rest of us do our own thing. It is a form of madness to have a health care, or any system, that gives taxpayer money to people who are perfectly capable of looking after themselves.
"delayed the next ice age by 30 to 50 thousand years." Hadn't realized these could be timed. Regardless. So delaying the next ice age is bad? 12,000 years ago much of Canada was under a sheet of ice. Not sure offhand how far south it went.
Thanks for your insight Tom. Business rules and Action Groups drool in the US. No surprise on GWB, worst President to EVER to steal an election.
Facts, figures and relevant empirical evidence? Obviously this communication has not been blessed by the PMO. The Harper Government?: Dumb On Health Care
Thank you. You've said what we all know to be true, Mr. Lacroix is not the president of the CBC.. he's just a messenger. Hopefully that will come to an end in the Fall of 2016
Sarkozy is not even the leading candidate for the right-wing LR - Alain Jupp? has been leading for some time.
It's not a mistake when you do it deliberately.
How could you do that? Support the Party but not Harper! Harper is the Conservative Party. Globe speaking from both side of mouth? Just lost me.
'slow recovery'***Fort Mac will recover faster than Gary Mason can say 'retirement.'
You should have tried to deal with other countries when the Liberals were in charge, Harper has done much better. Mulroney understood the world and the role of diplomats better than all the recent PMs.
Very well said!
Don't include me either. Harper is inciting a small group of xenophobes to lash out against minorities. Shameful.
@Jack O'Douley Excellent reply... Well Said. // ..
doble2 Virtually no hospital supplies and two spy helicopters. Need to redo the math on this??----------GOOD POINTi have yet to read a list of the hospital supplies, now that you mention ithow many suitcases of supplies?
Good argument for some kind of guaranteed income supplement.
The solution seems a bit mercenary, but then life is full of quid pro quo.
So It's Harpers fault so many Aboriginal women have gone missing ? I'm amazed at how powerful this ONE man is ..
158 Canadians died and several thousand were wounded in the Afghanistan War....Lest we Forget....
Reality is anti-China according to you....
JohnK, you are the only other poster here who mentions the possibility of corrupt intervention for financial gain.
You forgot to mention that the Americans also ate Salvadorian babies.

What's the difference between belief and religion?

140 IQ not bright?
When the suppliers are using inordinate amounts of money to influence lawmakers to support their product, we should probably begin to blame the suppliers and the lawmakers.
So you are arguing that Harper had an illegitimate government with 20% of eligible voter support. Now you fully support Trudeau completely changing how our democracy functions with the EXACT SAME level of support. You are a hypocrite.
As a matter of fact, he had been elected dog catcher.
Trudeau Jr. is absolutely giddy about the possibility of screwing Alberta. If Tredeau Sr. was still here he would be saying ' thats my boy!'.
In the US today, the top 1% of Americans now take in 25% of the nation's annual income, and control 40% of all the wealth. US income disparity today is similar to that of South and Central America 100 years ago.
You're such a bigot who is 'evangelical'phobic and Christianphobic. You probably also call Harper an islamophobe now don't you?
Care to enlighten us on the right way? And while you are at it, would you care to enlighten us on the relevance of Russia's role in WW2?
I guess both are equally wrong, n'est-ce pas. The wrong one in this comment thread was posted by April Showers.
It should surprise no one that eventually, uncontrolled socialism eventually results in a reaction in the form of a Mike Harris. The left never learns.
except Wynne didn't smoke crack, make as ass of herself in a drunken stupor several times, demonstrate a startling lack of understanding of even the basics of how her job works, etc. But you're right, it's totally the same.
who knows, God may very well exist... I just don't think he's visited for quite a while
This professor does a lot of cherry picking to bolster his argument. Let us hope that saner heads prevail and a political solution is arrived at.
Scotty, What was the percentage of Canadians got together and threw Harper out?
You know it's funny, I just saw a photo retweeted again today of Margaret Hamilton. You know, the woman responsible for Apollo 11 landing on the moon.
welcome--you re a good member of the family
At best this move by the Trudeau Liberals is isolationism. At worst it's appeasement. Trudeau has already embarrassed Canada and it's day 2?Justin should go to the front lines like Harper did before making any decisions.
That sign could be seen in Ontario, Qu?bec and Alberta, tired of being sucked off by the other 7 provinces of this fake country.
This article illustrates the issue: another left-wing media attack without facts, supporting the $billion per year public subsidy to the Communist Broadcasting Corporation.
Yeah no shit, but the point is you'll be an insufferable pseud homosexual if you say it that way when speaking English
James, the same can be said for your posts.
Hey ACE. What are YOUR solutions? Just so we know where you're coming from. Because all I can see is a Muslim hater, and nothing more.
LOL!! As I said, If no wealth is created by the public sector and is actually an expense to the economy then eliminate it. Then we'll see how well private enterprise prospers.
A drowned rat would make a better prime minister than Harper.
Abbadee, Abbadee!
Thumbs up to both of you, by virtue of the logic of flipping this over. Any monetary incentive to save energy is almost completely lost when so much of the bill is fixed charge.
We already have a multi-tiered system in Canada. The military, workers compensation patients, professional athletes, and politicians are treated differently from the general public.

'Tim Berners-Lee developed the worldwide web'Wait a minute Al Gore said he invented it. Is this another fantasy I've had ruined? Next thing you know people will be saying the Easter Bunny isn't real.
Do they cover their faces? Nuns are not mainstream - they are an order. And, today, most of them don't wear the habit. As for Sikhs - they don't cover their faces. So, your point is completely irrelevant.
Irony, yes?
That's not what meta-data is. If say, a photo is data, meta data would be the camera that was used, the f-stop, exposure etc. It's data about the data. I agree with your post, I just wanted to correct that error lest it cause confusion.
Sixty percent of the population of Canadian prisons have not been given a court date for the charges against them. They have not yet been found guilty of the charge.

Multi-culturalism. Isn't it great? This should be a lesson to the far-left multi-cultis. When some cultures proliferate their base attitudes unchecked, they pose a threat to our national values.
'Not offending' is faint praise, but I'm happy for the student.

I think I will take the Mayors word for it over some media hack!
Actually the Heartland piece is a well known example of disinformation spread by the energy lobby. If you want to go to an accurate source try NASA. http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/
You're right. You don't know much about Scott. He pled the 5th - 75 times to avoid conviction. You'll figure it out eventually.
Typical Harper brownosing response. Simpson has has always provided balanced criticism of Harper. You just can't stand it when someone criticizes the guy in the blue sweater.
As usual, shoot the messenger but don't offer any credible counter argument. Also don't mention the fact that Murdock papers backed remain.

As for Confucius Institute, it should be banned completely by all countries. It is the Chinese Teacher Union's vacation program, totally a waste of Chinese tax payer's money.
Well said. Thank you for the informative post.
A Reader, So Justin never said that? I'm sincerely just asking.
A well-researched and thought-out piece of journalism by Mr. Saunders, one of Canada's best. Hahaha!
Yes, time to move forward, respect right and the rule of law, not try to enforce a monoculture on other people.
It won't take your advice.
Name any government at any in Canada that makes evidence based decisions.
Before actually reading this article, and solely based on its title, I was expecting propaganda and drivel. But what the Mayor says is substantive. Good on you Mr. Mayor. Thank you.
That's silly. I would not waste it (I do not, not even watering the lawn), but there would be an extra incentive if any savings would be expressed in dollars.
Guess you'd better man up then.
The Liberals were hypocritical in their decision making. You think their supporters would be outraged!
yes she will emulate Harper
I am not white but i do think the #whitelash coming from Black people is bit on the racist side. When Obama was elected, did white people come and call it blacklash?? Racism is racism.
MM: What do you call the overwhelming majority? Just curious.
Did you miss the part about debt-to-GDP?
Really? Did you somehow miss Mulroney reviving separatist fervor all on his own?
And you get to determine whose opinions are worthwhile or worthless?
We're self-aware. But you're not. There's NOTHING about Canada's role in this. Eh?
Not soon enough bro'.
Pretty much. We've always jumped whenever our friends down south have asked us to. This won't change with Harper or with Big Bird in Ottawa. Death, taxes, and a malleable lackey up north.
Thank you Globe. It is nice to see that somebody is willing to point out the difference between the 2 very distinct roles that the Professor did hold. It would appear that the learned professor was unable to make this distinction for himself.
And Trudeau is addicted how?
The word, haygagan, is 'RELEVANT' and, I beg to differ. See my comment.
The 'method' to this madness is diabolical, very diabolical. Will the people (old stock francophone whom the PQ target) buy it? Are there enough old stock francophone to vote them into majority?
The people of Crimea will fight back. The majority was not for. All an illusion.
and turkey is usually less than a buck a pound at this time of year ...
Happy with life appears to be what's been dubbed a 'concern troll'.
Cookie cutter progressive eco-socialism is what Trudeau is all about. The formula will fail every time but does he care when he really does not care about Canadians. His role as PM is nothing more than a happy facade for sinking ship!
Or.... as leader of a federation where cooperation with provinces is critical.... has consistently refused to meet with premiers since early 2009?.... six years. He is now actively trying to smear at least two of them. Fail.
Gawd the substitute the word black thing is So tired
So will a Liberal Gov't add 2% to the GST then? Will it increase corporate taxes?
Wow... kids, here is live dinosaur, if you haven't seen one yet...
Why is that? Why is it unfair. Having gone the the Fairvote. ca site it seems like the biggest supports are those who didn't play enough sport in school so they didn't become gracious losers.
Not really. Not the same thing at all.
Maybe its the fact we are a secular country and don't practice Islam in their medieval way. Many believe it is their jobs to kill off all infidels.
That's what this all about: it was entirely predictable that the same bunch of Harpies who promote Canadian mines and Alberta bitumen overseas would tie aid to trade.
Calgary City Council did the right thing in removing fluoride from the drinking water for several reasons including cost and lack of comfort of the effectiveness and safety of fluoridation.

'Like most prime ministers, Mr. Harper seeks to impose his biases.'Subversion is the operative word here, not imposition.
Hurry and do take your meds !
@Japac Huh? Secular = money and power Sectarian = destroy those whose philosophical concepts of a higher power differ from yours.
Is this reheated leftover some sort of bellwether piece the Globe is floating to gauge their readers' interest in examining the 'Ford Fenomena'?It's no big mystery to anyone paying attention and it's been done to death
power more important than people, manning's words when interveiwed on the radio.
Another exercise in how to get to YES. We must fight this massive sell off of BCs resources for peanuts. Christy Clark has no clue. We must live with a level or shrinking economy for a few years yet.
Have you done any research to verify the NDP, Green and Bloc's position on FP? I have, and I know you have not.
As opposed to Stephen Harper who was caught delivering a speech that a speechwriter had plagiarized from the Australian PM?
I buy all my beer in Ontario and bring it back to Manitoba. To he11 with Greg Selinger and his price gouging. 24 beer in Ontario: $32.95; 24 beer in Manitoba: $47.95. Ridiculous.
"Good governance and fiscal prudence " were you able to type that with a strait face Stephan ?
...because the government told them that they had to. Couldn't discriminate against people who had no income, no job and no assets.
Lovely rehashing of BC Liberal talking points. I know they've been buying a lot of newspaper ad space but this is something else. Is this actually a re-election endorsement for Premier Clark? Hard to tell.
more left wing fear mongering... the left has just as scary protesters but the media can't see it because they protest against the right everyday ...yawn it's getting boring now!
'Aboriginal protests are treated carefully?' That has to be the understatement of the year. If you or I were armed and blocking a railway rack I guarantee we would be shot full of holes by an RCMP goon squad and that would be the end of it.
In what way is the G&M 'out of touch'? Be specific. Isn't a (supposed) billionaire also an 'elitist'???

Gosh, I been in the woods so long, I can't spell 'fur trade'
Afghanistan was never a coherent state in it's own right - contrary to the politically correct history that it was a 'kingdom' ....
Indeed. But the problem is deeper and wider: imperialism at home and abroad with its system of scapegoatism that gives the disaffected a variety of low level targets for their hatred.
At one moment, the surge in thumb-down votes for all comments not praising this petty propaganda rubbish (written by proven shill Dougy) was beyond belief. Whoever does it needs to use less crude techniques.....

How's this for irony. SunTV and OUTtv are in bed together, both seeking mandatory carriage.
I do remember the unions paying members to support Trudeau.
What did Stephen Harper ever do before he was in politics? Nothing substantial that is for sure. But he did spend a lot of time writing articles about how bad Canada was as a nation and how we need to be much more like the US.
Holy hyperbole! He's not gonna close every (often excellent) Mexican restaurant or build a wall around Hamtramck.
Especially when they end up choosing and implementing he system that most benefits the Liberal Party and ensures Liberal governments forever. That's the very essence of democracy.
With the advent of the 24 hour news cycle and the Internet, A lot of the media have blurred the lines between reporting and opinion.

Do you want to learn let alone listen?
You mean he ignores genetics, DNA as it suits him. For the immigrants, Marxism is fine, for the him and French they are special, like the natives, the jews, the feminists etc.
They too are blowing it out of proportion.
Harper's tax-salaried shills produce nothing but lies and crap.
Cons hate unions because unions created the middle class (decent wages, pensions and medicare, human/worker rights, etc), and we all know that the Cons love minimum wage and despise an informed, empowered, organized middle class.
also while BJK was retired when she was outed by a palimony suit, Navratilova was most definitely NOT retired, an in fact would go on to win 16 more Major titles after coming out, dominating tennis in the 1980s

The left and journalism just lost The Big One. Now they are going to fight to see information controlled so that such a thing doesn't happen again. MiniTru, 2017.
There clearly is a significant ethical void in Justin. No matter what your party stripe, it's laid completely bare for all to see.
'Harper's reform base is going to be wooed by ringing the old anglo-white manifest destiny bell...' for the rural voters. In the city, something else. And he can get away with such bifurcated nonsense with the help of the MSM in articles like this.
Thrym - did you used to be known as the poster who went by the name 'Seth'? He was a huge booster of nuclear power - you know, too cheap to meter, etc, etc. I'm surprised he hasn't chirped in yet.
This remark is simply insane, though not out of place in context.
Some people will find everything racist, unless it gratifies their own ego.
There were white middle class women who died at Pickton's hands. You are wrong. They all had the same lifestyle though. People were telling them not to go with the guy. They went anyways for the drugs.

@OgtheDim: You mean we in Toronto should pay for transit for someone living outside of our city? Any such relief line should be payed for by taxing the 905 appropriately. You want a subway in Thornhill? Then let Tornhillians pay for it.
In the absence of proportional representation, Green energies are better spent in ENGO activities than in electoral politics -- with the exception perhaps of efforts in selected ridings.

OK, that would explain why Canada's indigenous population seems to resist being nationalized, so to speak. Ironic, eh. Any solutions to that issue other than reserves for 'foreigners' or assimilation given the rejection of elitist multiculturalism?

Next up, 'Will Canada stay in Israel's embrace?' Don't think so. We were an honest broker with real diplomatic influence for 50 years in the ME, until Mr. Harper came along. Trudeau will dump blind loyalty to Israel, sure as shootin.
The CBC has always, in my lifetime, torn into the government of the day. It certainly tore into Chretien's government, as well. As for its bias against PM Harper - yes, it was always evident. From day one.

Yeah, I thought that when she made the comment about the decision to 'go after' the NDP in Quebec. She noted she was against that for strategic reasons, as if she shouldn't have been against it because it was race-baiting garbage.

Tesla is losing large sums of money. May not survive long.
Just because u read Nat'l Enquirer doesn't mean that u believe all the nonsense. Likewise Twitter. Hilary lost because she was outsmarted by DT and we were all let down by people too lazy to vote.
Not that we should celebrate swirling around the drain, eh? Maybe "global economy" means that we will achieve the lowest common denominator but that's doesn't mean we should be happy about it.
Ancaster... What does your post have to do with the current situation?
Wow Proscenium. You got smoked!
We hear hardly anything from brown so its hard to evaluate his position on anything.
I noticed that too.
And on vacations.
Let bch speak if he./she wants to., logically presented arguments are rare here.
Rememberance Day is the time for Canadians to honour those who served and/or sacrificed their lives for our freedoms especially those who fought against fascism in World Wars I and II.Lest we forget.
Calgary = Huston Northa compliment - not an insult
Tx for a great article. You almost converted me back to liberal. But you didn't mention prorogation when it was politically convenient, likely because they all did it.
It has nothing to do with demographics, because the age of immigrants matches the age of Canadians. So... Although we bring in more people, we gain more elderly at the same rate. It's about lobbyists and political friends pushing for cheap labour.
As a matter of fact he has attacked the queen http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/jeff-rosemartland/national-day-of-honour_b_5250484.html
The new government in Ukraine is not a right-wing fascist government. Like all democracies, there are right wing parties, left-wing parties, centrist parties, single issue parties etc. That is what democracy is all about.
'Let's be real for once. When has Canada ever really truly mattered in the world? How about never. WW I and WW II - when the world needed us. But not since we started electing Liberal PMs
Cool smile.
I hope that you're willing to wager large sums of money on Trump being elected. It will be so pleasant to know you paid a price to be a fool.
What's a few learning glitches? Even if they cost a few billion.....
Imagine after 4 to 5 years more governmental pillaging of the Canadian people some actress crooning here: 'Don't cry for me Ca-na-da'Ontarian's cann fill in 'Owe-tari-ooo'
Pay the firefighters by the call. Only when they are doing the job. Not while they are waiting for the 'work' to show up.
How many of the promises of devolution made during the independence referendum will be kept? The SNP can keep pushing and reminding Scots of those promises.
Quebec is a successful multi-tribe democracy. As is the entire Country.
Art... go home.
I guess there is a point that addresses my comment but I fail to see it.
It does seem rather strange that we are killing ourselves for the benefit of the highly placed psychopaths who will ask us to train our foreign replacements once we return from our alleged 'holidays'.
no ???...an other one ???...how many of you in ROC with such disease ???...is there any ANTIDOTE in the ROC against disease such as 'R.C.S.S.' (Radio-Canada Separatits Syndrome) ???

How can one have peace talks with a bunch of guys who occupied buidings at gun point, who made not one peaceful demand before doing so?
PQ rank and file believe the fantasy; the brass believes that the spin will get them concessions.
You should also give up on your ideas and stop contributing spam.
another cpc troll. They're all over every topic with one cheap dig after another... get a real job.
Gotta agree - all of a sudden the media discovered (invented?) a new racial sub-group 'White-Hispanic'. If Zimmerman had just been 'Hispanic' this would never have made the front page of the paper let alone seen Obama and Holder join the fray.
Ontario nuclear reactors have never killed a single bird or bat in 40 years of operation. Ontario wind turbines kill thousands each year.
If we don't sell them the ordinance, some-one else will, has to be the laziest ethical cop out argument. Why not just say we will sell them the ordinance. All consequences be damned, and the devil take the...
Kamies, I love it. Canada would make a wonderful summer camp in July and August For living it's better in the Bahamas.
Doc, Don't be so harsh on the woman. She's in mourning.
In terms of getting the project done, the more important question is who will accept the research once it is done. Harper and Enbridge have long demonstrated that they do not even understand the question.
You just lost the argument.
Well then that drops Kenny from your list of future PMs. But I bet you didn't realize that now did you?
Widespread abuse? Given?
You don't sound much better
so, marlon, you're a moron and i am not? i'm confused. help me here. you started your sentence with a capital letter. did you mean to?
You obviously haven't gathered that to Sunny Daze and his guilt ridden band ofintelligentsia, people who don't see things their way are racist and uncaring.

'The threat to democracy is not just fake news, or even Facebook itself ? it?s that nobody can any longer agree on what is actually true.'No, it's that for a large proportion of the population, no one cares.
There is no news in this piece. Any benefit of reading it was not worth the exposure to some very lame syntax and hackneyed expression.
And in other predictions, it will definitely rain in 2016.
I?ll be ?proud? when Canada achieves education for for all, so that emotive opinion pieces like this with no basis no longer exist.
Thanks K Wright I am at a loss on what to say about this authors conscious and deliberately misleading piece of tripe and your words are spot on.
Simpson and his crowd of antiseptic eco-prudes will have to wait until proportional representation makes Lizzie May into a Prime Minister. Then, the lot of you can skate triumphantly on the ice at Green Hades Gardens.
'Moronic expressions....' Why does that make me think of Harper?
Believe me, I've known lots of women who have made bad or inappropriate choices. Humans as a whole are far from perfect. Madame Wente should finally get into the twentieth century.
Miller - you really are a bore - and ill-informed too. Both Trump & Hillary were elected by a majority in their respective primaries. Enough of this 9% nonsense.
You have no idea what atheism means
Canadians deserve better than a quasi wealthy tv personality to lead our country.
So we don't need drunk driving laws, speed limits, public health care, trade laws, minimum wage laws, etc? Think your theories through a little bit next time, buddy.
This is more Smoke & Mirrors than Smoke & Water. Instead of not accepting voluntary tips, Jones charges a mandatory 15% tip. In other words, contrary to the 'No Tipping' sign, Jones needs to erect a 'Mandatory 15% Tip' sign. What a scam.
Looking at the US with longer experience with the modern forms of voter suppression. It's only going to get worse.
Probably not - feminists and socialists want women to monopolize sex and punish men for any and all sexual desires. Porn, being an outlet, gets their scorn and they demand it be outlawed.
Read todays news! The guy is charged with sexual harassment! He is also a sanctimonious bore ( not that that disqualifies one from high public office.)
Suuure, and Russia and Canada have what in common exactly? Russians can't even play hockey very well. Their Vodka consumption has dulled their minds...
a man for all seasons
So you are sending a letter to the editor telling him/her what articles and points of view you approve of? Perhaps you should apply for the position of federal censor.
Maybe Harper can send you a free carton of cigarettes.
yes. yes it is...
I don't mind shutting down your street and local hospital. Don't use them anyway.
Lisa Helps, take note!
So you're saying that it's up to Blacks to prevent trigger happy cops from shooting them?
Good article - about a career path that has become a monopoly enclave of overpaid professional whiners.
PSA tests on Ontario are not covered by OHIP. Just another form of discrimination against men. Perhaps ....in the name of equality... there should be a fee for mammography and Pap tests to the same tune as men shell out for their PSA testing.
....and choosing the snide and smirking Ambrose as interim leader underlines how little they want to change.
Clothing has nothing to do with rape. Nothing.
You do have a point for sure. Look at the build up of troops and machinery on the NATO side of the borders over there in Europe.
You need a more nuanced approached to the dentist and his wife than 'religious nuts'.
I think saying stupid things is a liberal thing
cheapchirp loves Black-Ford wisdom. You're so lucky, in Qu?bec we cannot enjoy their mature vision of fairplay. Such Superior minds!
Most to the point Op-Ed on Haroer's economic mismanagement.
I think the strategy may be to use the vouching as a smoke screen and distract the attention from the points you noted. Don't be suprised if they throw out a token concession on vouching but keep everything else intact.
Doubtful! It's slash the budget and slag the veterans; hardly matches the rhetoric.
Why do outsiders constantly try and tell us about our values?
Me too, but dreary has its own appeal, sort of like Glenn Gould's love of battleship grey.
We don't want it known that he lived here, okay? Shhhh!
And it was the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien that kept us out of Iraq.
Wasn't it the Taliban that Canadians were fighting in Afghanistan? Now aren't the Taliban fighting against ISIS. Lets not get all mixed up.
as 'sarcasm'
Thank you. 60 billion in corporate welfare - not mentioned here at all. This paper is a disgrace and should just rename itself the Harper Post
No, Nenshi is not too urbane. He's just too much of a whiny drama queen.
Wall, compromise? Wall tried to kill the whole process. Actually, it isn't over yet as Manitoba has just reopened Pandora's Box.
You should know about expense account politicians - the Tory party is full of them.
Any school teacher that can't teach K to 8 mathematics well should be summarily fired.
Talk about 'fake' news. Every time I read an column like this I see how the Main Street Media (MSM) is getting more and more irrelevant every day.
And Canada has no ability to fix it.
Ancient: The Quebec law passed before the Carter Vs State decision. The Quebec statute mandated that a fatal disease be present. Now that SCC has stated they must include irreversible suffering, they are having to take a second look.
Anyone seen the body?
don't you know? it is always the Caucasians' responsibility to make things right. (I am not Caucasian btw. I do think it's all non-sense!)
Well said. The Ontario uber wealthy have forgotten where they got their wealth from-- the labour of other Ontarians.
Keep dreaming Simpson. One by-election proves nothing. And polls are about as reliable as your columns.
Send Saudi ambassadors home from all western countries and freeze all assets of Saudi Arabia in the west..........ISIS threat gone within 3 months!
Ah, so there are no "universal principles" at stake here. Your defense of that idea would make an interesting read. The ICC is just not relevant to you ?
Not just cops shot by black criminals, but also punched, spat on, knifed, beaten, and assaulted. We are expected to think only 12% of such events happen by black suspect because that is ratio of the black population in the US.
Very good column! I'm glad that at least a sensible mind in Canada can see this. American liberals are in complete denial.
While we're sharing personal facts that have nothing to do with the column: My dog has a fluffy tail.
Why does anyone still care what the United Nations says ?
Bigger words for the same ideas. She has a thesaurus.
Oh, great idea Kathleen, you are so progressive. Every damn road going into Toronto will have tolls, should be great for Toronto businesses'!No wonder the rest of Ontario hates Toronto. They even have for Torontonians-cityiots.
Last I read, Zarny, maroons are a tribe native to inland Jamaica. Not sure what that has to do with knowledge of biology
Henceforth, Russuian athletes will have no credibility, even in their own country.

No, government sponsored socialism is NOT the answer. You can't move the poor out of poverty by taxing the rich into poverty. You can't tax your way to prosperity.
Don what's the matter, life not working out so well for you?
Allan....here is some information on this 'medication' ...perhaps you should take to read it.http://www.ru486facts.org/index.cfm?page=sideeffectsSuch lunacy being hailed as a 'gold standard' can only be labeled as fools gold.
Quebec gets the almost half of all equalization payments from the Feds. This allows them to have the lowest tuition and day care rates in the country. Quebec like FN's are very privileged.
'But if we broke it down into more logical categories...'Stop using your hierarchical, patriarchal male 'logic' and join us in our rape-hysteria!
Hilarious. Obviously written by someone who doesn't live in Polak's ridiing. She's a right winger through and through.
Matureguy: Please read some other responses here, and you'll begin to understand what Buford Wilson wrote as he did.
Money and sacrifice and the fact that climate change/global warming won't kill us overnight.
They are not "intellectually lazy," they have ideologically driven purpose - which means no future plans, that's being left up to the bloody market.
Change of ownership.
Ark, that goes double for you too. Or are you special?
Have been for a long time, certainly at the fed level. Chretien was a director at TD Bank. Junior finance minister D.D. Peters was chief economist there. McCallum was at Royal.
We must keep fear mongering our own children with our climate change exaggeration so we can finally defeat the evil fear mongering neocons?
She can at least came she tried and if they refuse to cooperate, she can blame them.
ITS CALLED HOPE AND HARD WORK NOT FEAR AND STUPIDITY. That is how the Libs will push harper to 3rd party status.
The U.S. along with their allies are the perpetrators of the proxy war in Syria. America has never had an issue with despots, only the ones they can't control.
Your response was deeply ignorant.
I bet given the chance, more Canadians would opt to go south than Americans to go north.
Spanking has a place in Canada. Period.
*forgotten Syria - sorry about the typo
It's also worth noting that the Iran nuclear deal was approved unanimously by the UN Security Council on July 20th. Now has the force of international law, it will difficult for Canada, or any other country, to ignore it.
another lost soul
Agree totally. There are too many countries in this country it appears.
I'm not overly political but this is crap. Canada is lucky to have a man of Mr Flaherty's ability in this job. Don't screw him up with nonsense.
Or anyone but himself.
His physically grabbing her might be considered physical coercion.
Start looking for a new team Jose.
Elvin, Trump will just make crap up, like he does everything else. And the media will report it in the interest of "balance and fairness"....
if Allan is for unions why is he against police unions?
He talks pro immigration but walks another line. The immigration reforms he has put in place prove that fact.
.Jeffrey Simpson/ Kevin Page: Liberal hacks!
What evidence do you have that there isn't?
If aboriginal people are still suffering problems as a direct result of the residential school system (they are if you bothered to look) you (and the rest of society) are not innocent, even today.
I suspect your situation is exceptional. Not my experience ....
Yes perhaps we should show some love and remove these children from these 'hating' parents. If they resist, send the Swat teams. I'm sure you have nothing but 'love' for those who disagree with you.
Hmmm '...so many rational liberal minds...'. No there is an oxymoron if I ever saw one. A
Champagne socialists or white wine set aka white whiners :>)
Beachcombers? Are you kidding me?
too bad for you that the latest poll says 70% of Canadians support the Queen and GG
Well anybody who has an education worth discussing and big boy job experience will be an improvement over Rock Star. The next four years are going to make for great media, theirs no scripting for opposition!
...and, conteagmon - this is why most posters here are clamouring for the abolition of the 10 percenters.
I was disappointed by Dawkins. He's got a religious fervor about his atheism that turns me off.
If we all have "rights" what about the related responsibilities ???
Sounds like a desperate move to me. Also could send out the wrong message to other countries on a potential back door approach to EU membership. Perhaps the economic migration of Serbians and Muslims will be the straw that destroys EU.
Cutting off medical assistance for children of refugees is just one example. ____________________Excuse me, but I don't even have medical paid for myself. How can you justify us all paying taxes for everyone but not receiving the services ourselves?
All Canadian are created equal... some however more equal than others! Tick tick tick ... 2015.... election....ABC
Do you have a point to make? Then please do so. The selfie thing is getting old.
You didn't like my story? Its all true
Look who's acting like a five years old now.
good rebuttal from djw and GKnighBC
Such a comeback. I am mortally wounded. Oh right, you didn't have anything to say.
Indeed... this is what one of the paid ostriches said yesterday. http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/canada-not-at-war-with-isil-say-trudeau-and-dion-following-brussels-attacks
Yankee, simple - he thought that was the best place to go. And Canada isn't a medical dictatorship (yet) and you can't stop people from going abroad for treatment if they believe that is the best option.
How is he denying the voters anything?
Chimp....please,that is just not smart.
I'm sure glad I have AdBlock so that when I click on these clickbait 'stories', G&M doesn't make any money.
So what are you facts, what science have you got. Enlighten us please
Yes just what we want running the county ... a bunch of old hippies at a love in. Grow up you fool.
As a voter, that's jsut what I am going to do.

How would you respond to the many Muslims who are thrilled with the Charter?
And total satire from posters like Mel Well Done!!!
Many in Germany, France, Poland might look on England with envy. Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark also have restive populations fulminating in discontent.
"dumb", "see loser"....no, you are the one not being civil here. If you have an argument to make, make it, but don't insult people who disagree with you.
...which is why the less we talk about him the better.
Actually it was developed by lefties to make fun of each other for the ever changing "correct" language in lefty circles. And just like Saul Alinsky, it was co-opted and turned in to a right wing meme and hobby horse.
The climate change activists build their arguments on fraudulent claims. Let them live without the carbon economy and report back how that goes.
I think it says more about the Liberal Party than it does about Canadians apathy. There simply is no viable second option for most Canadians.
Why would you ever train a recent Canadian grad when you can hire a TFW?? The Canadian Government is bending over backwards to help people outside this country over Canadians....this has to change.
examples please
Well, it's kind of like Clinton's 'I never had sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lesinsky...'Some things you are supposed to lie about.
So, while people are dying of all of these things you're worried about losing a dictionary entry?
That's why it got so many thumbs down. How dare anyone think for themselves, or do any research, or express an opinion other than 'take away their kids'
Another one of those 'write something to fill a space' articles.
Dante's thinking: GHG emissions are down, Liberal policies are working! Meanwhile, industry has packed up and left the province taking good-paying jobs with them.
Terrorists that beheaded 12 Egyptian fisherman have nothing whatsoever to do with Khadr.
Nice try Art, but look who you're trying to 'reason' with. They know what they're up to and do it consciously.
We don't need no stinkin' UN. Those details distract me from my re election and permanent changes to this country. I have my eye on you and your environmental terrorist friends. S. Harper
Bill might be a serial rapist, but his wife is a kind, generous, honest woman who's served her country admirably.....Now please excuse me while I puke.
totally agree. Spot on... shameful display by these officers - save the individual that initiated CPR - anyone who doesn't see the aggressive, anger filled, power drunk rage of this cop is ignorant...
Agreed. Small money is for small minds. Prioritize accordingly.
So, why do they keep you as a friend?
Rule of law, not rule of God
Not climate scientists, though.
Let the Quebec government take over the bridge. The Feds couldn't care less about the local impact of tolls... or quality obviously.
Clearly, correct spelling is of no concern to you.
No one reads pots that are in ALL CAPITALS, because they are seen as rude. Get some manners
with a name like Milt, you were probably born an old frumpy broad
I was no big fan of Chretien, but compared to Harper the man was a saint.
Separate but equal was struck down by the United States Supreme Court in 1954; Brown vs. the Board of Education. Of course, this is Canada.
Wrong!
Harper lives in a parallel universe. Actually it's not even parallel, it's skewed to ours.
9/11 and all the subsequent attacks in many western countries.....
Canada 1. So you don't think that folks who disagree with your political views have access to the media. They should just continue watching the CBC and reading the Toronto Star. Hardly bi-partisan.
Did it question Islam, or hold it up to critical observation?
Lawrence, it sounds like you're panicking. (and rightly so)
Yet again with the personal shots without any substance to your arguments. One has to wonder about your abilities.
The wolf/ungulate balance is out of kilter. The wolf kill is justified.
Politics today is only about crowd pleasing, little else matters. As long as the crowd is with you there is no need for policy or principle.
Even though Palestinians bomb Israeli towns and communal farms. Terrorism.
More click bait from the Globe.
Welcome back poke. We all missed your funny, pithy, fact free comments.
Yes, and so do thousands of vulnerable people who do not want to be involuntarily euthanized.
They don't worship Chavez, they love him.
I think Harper and Flaherty should have a behind closed doors meeting with Ford and request that he resign. Maybe Harper can offer him a seat in the senate if he resigns, or how would $90,000 sound?
Please visit Cuba - then post ....
Don't the DNC emails prove the system is rigged? If not, why did 4 DNC staffers resigned immediately after?
Now for the good news in the gene pool.
Couldn't say it any better.
I wonder how much his groomer [hair dresser] is costing the taxpayer?
What's it worth to save an industry? Maybe maximizing profits is not an option now.
In my view the people who invented this delicious taxing scam should get an Olympic award. Can we actually get an accountant's audit on the climate? Haha.
Such a great point!
Right on Michele. And they have the media such as the G&M to help.
And your suggestion for improvement is?More bureaucracy? Small is beautiful.
Not quite rebuilt, McCallum, Goodale, Martin, Chretien, Garneau, Bryson et al are still regrettably there. They represent what they call the good old day, you know sponsorship etc.
How has Mr. Harper handed Putin? He button-holed him at a cocktail party and shook his fist at some Russian fighter jets in the distance during one of his arctic junkets. I don't think Putin's too worried.
A lot of teachers quit and move on to other things when they figure out the profession's not for them.

The short answer is NOSome allies??? like Canada are actually pulling out !
I forgot the world is flat and only 150 years old to you neo-cons.
So how does $250 Million now inching towards a Billion? and its not even complete yet?
800 page Harper omnibus bill? I should say so.
Our Immigration policies and numbers haven't really changed in 30 years. Canada has ranked in the top 5 places to live for about the same time. Is Immigration to blame?
"Read our own Chrystia Freeland" Evidently you're not, GV, since she attributes the conflict to Putin and recommends stronger sanctions against members of his inner circle. Inconvenient for your narrative, that.
Every member of the House of Commons should read this before voting next week on Harper's Nonsense War.

Much different. The adscam had the purpose of saving the country in a referundum, although that does not justify the methods. Unless you think destroying democracy is a good goal, I see a huge difference
The Supreme Court is not God.
@joefrmedm.Another Con Bot sore loser. With all the money that was made during the oil boom where did it go. Since the Cons are such Masters of Finance.
One person did this so all males are blamed. Sounds like sexism to me because a whole group is being attacked because one member of that group did something. If one woman beats her child should all women be blamed?
Our PM EARNS ever 'rude and disgusting remark' ever typed about him.

Canada's very own left wing version of Sarah Palin. My name is Joe Dick and I endorse Junior Trudeau.

No, the schemes he's talking about have only been around since the late 80's.When the decline really began ...
Albertans are the only ones left that know the more you give government the more they waste
'the response should be harsh and unanimous'=====It will be neither, airhead.
Are you saying the Liberals have adopted right-wing/Conservative/unfettered capitalist mentality??
May they continue to fail!
Harper doesn't need airy-fairy armchair pseudo conservatives like you. Next you'll be wearing a baby trudeal hairstyle.
Canada is full of bullies because they enable beta socialist losers.

The ROC knows the truth, the Kid is all about Quebec. Anything else is spin.

How can you call it Christmas without there being a religious connotation? Christ - mas. As in Jesus the Christ. Get it?
And if he didn't sign-off what then? How long would the BLM sit-in continue until they finally realize their protest is viewed as PR gone bad? That aside, the smoke flares were not appreciated.
She'll take it in the face but not the arm?

'What technology gives , it takes away.' 'Perhaps'? Don't really give a damn ? The root of the problem of course , the self-absorbed.
Why wait for the Globe to act? Why not post under your real name now?
Nonsense. Those resources are useless without Western industrial technology. A less enlightened society like the Russians or Chines would have slaughtered the Natives and taken them by force.
did you refer to harassment 20 years ago as 'trumpworld'
I wouldn't say 'criminally stupid' but I would agree that a large swath of voters continue to be persuaded to vote against their own self-interest.
You mean like Pol Pot?
unfortunately true and that's also what he did as Energy Minister
As your quote suggests, Dyson is not a denier and recognizes the harm caused by climate change. His disagreement is with the extent of the problem. On that point, almost all climate and earth scientists disagree with him.
neither one are civil servants they work for trudeau
Did any of you bleeding heart pollyanna liberals think that Germany could absorb one million Muslims in a year with no negative repercussions? No one gets it.
He is not rich enough, took bags of cash but not enough.
Lefties want free speech and satire as long as the fundamentalist Muslims are not offended.
Maybe that is the difference between the previous generations of Muslim immigrants, and the more recent?
Taxpayer-funded hate mail. A new CPC low.
It's because middle-aged white guys are important.
So....what did the legislation regarding parole look like at the time of these occurrences?
Precisely. Snake oil salesmen of the 20-21st century.
Anybody But Communists!
Same thing with the Alberta PC party.
What middle class?
Take a look at the Old Testament. Women are hardly equals. The OT is where a good deal of the treatment of women in western culture begins. It continues in Xnity and Islam.
The only values that should be permitted are those approved by Gerald Butts.
The answer to your editorial question is 'YES' he is a huge liability. Bring on the awesome Trudeau team.
I agree. It's already been shown, hospital visits go down, other services ie:(police/fire) are also used less when basic needs are met.
The Globe & Mail did not post this comment about the man who blew himself by mistake in Germany.?One less ?refugee? Angela Merkel has to worry about.?Where is G&M your sense of fairness? You always shield the murderers.
Link HogbrowLOL....all right than. Cheers..
Agreed - I avoid them like the plague
Not threats to deport immigrants Alceste. The threat is to deport ILLEGAL immigrants. People who arrived by climbing fences, wading across rivers or simply flew in and did not leave again, as required by their travel documents.

Good grief, regulating the price of books to prevent consumers getting a better deal? Talk about pandering to union sh*tducks. Quebecers really do have no pride. And Quebecers really wonder why they are the laughing stock of Canada?
I don't care what the political pooh bahs do,care,or think about that great Confederate flag. I will continue to wear my Confederate kepi with the Stars and Bars on it. No one can tell me what to wear on my own head.
I could not agree more, Crimea is done. It will stay in Russia until Ukraine become a country attractive to reunite with. There will be attempts to destabilize situation in Crimea by Ukrainian nationalists, but there are no real grassroots for this.
That is part of the problem. But consider this: Indian Act was the foundation of reserves, elected chiefs and ' wards of the state'. What do you do to transition from dependence to independence and hwo lo9ng to build the necessary capacity?
Hey, David S ..... Google "hillary clinton webb hubbell daughter" ...!!
Unfortunately when the U.S. get involved things don't usually end up for the better.
The women card will play well in the northern states, but in the 'barefoot and pregment states' including Texas it will be a liability. The old confederacy states like'em barefoot and pregnant. Iowa could go either way.
Harper hasn't done any military service either, but he's anxious to send other people's family members into harm's way.
No surprise for me! The migrant invasion from Africa is heading North* and not East**, nor further South***.*Europe of course.**No way!***Absolutely not!
Sally Jenkins in Washington Post, copied by Lindy West, then put through Balkisson's own special opressed victim lense.... took an objective acutely researched and observed column from Jenkins and turned it into a whining manifesto.
Being masculine, caring and respectful have never been mutually exclusive.
Are you going after Trudeau in the sports and weather articles too?
Did you know him personally? If not, how do you know how devout he was?
It is tough to get by all the censors when commenting, but one must respect that the Journalists do have bosses and sometimes those bosses do not always want too much 'truth ' to get out there.
I would take Tony Soprano any day. He was true to himself and brutally honest with everyone else. Not like this bunch of lying cheat that run Queens Park.
What Non-sense....remember Mike Harris? The guy who had the biggest mouth of any provincial premier? The Mike Harris common sense revolution? Of course you don't....it's inconvenient. But now he has a very cushy job at Magna International.
A false-flag is a false-flag. It's a no-brainer, really.
The World Bank doesn't give a fig about the environment, energy misuse, security, or pollution. They are taking the viewpoint that a person can successfully ride the global Ponzi scheme in Canada better than somewhere else.
That was the mantra before Obama came along and skewered her.
Donald Trump might now want to put up a wall on the US-Canada border as well and he might even ask Canada to pay for it LOL
I contributed to Gawker's CrackStarter campaign, and I support your decision. The truth doesn't always come easy, and good principles can often conflict.
hey... do I get a royalty?...lol
have another beer, child.
You mean the $90,000 went from the government (as Nigel says) to the Royal Bank? No note attached?
When will the provinces pool resources to research inexpensive supplements such as Vit. C and Lysine for plaque reduction. Many swear by them and do nicely without stents which may cost $20K per patient over time while not extending life.
Your use of the word 'prove' bears witness to your intellect Chimp. Many of the rest of us don't need to be played for suckers in order to feel okay about ourselves.
Actually, some guy from Turkey just won a nobel prize in science this week.
one would expect someone like you to be an expert at identifying filth... you so many opportunities
Russia controlled the Crimea since 1783. Stalin decided to deport the poor Tartars in 1994 after defeating the Nazis in this area. It is great that the number of Tartars in the Crimea has increased.
It has nothing to do with the provinces; it only affects federal elections.
So on which point, or points, is she wrong here?
True enough.
Castro brothers are in their 80s, so the post-Castro days will come sooner or later.
Trump supporters chatter every bit as much as Clintons ... as this comment thread illustrates.
Kevin, see today's political cartoon, even the G&M, one of Harper's biggest supporters, sees Harper as King!
If they ask to search you, what then?
The article reads like he was not there, in the inner circle, when the ship went down. As he was one of the team piloting the TITANTIC I am not sure his recipe of all ahead full carries much weight.
And perhaps our media would report on this reality .....
Exactly what I was going to say. As usual with The Globe, not to deal with the real issue, which is that our own government acts against us.
It is kind of ironic that this story only came out a couple of weeks ago. LOL!
Let the kids do cart wheels. If not let them smoke.
The Liberal Party is a fungus.
Yes, I fear Harper might be thinking the same thing.
Look forward to equal candor from other public leaders on this topic.
Nepacific. While the Senate for the first few years of the Harper administration was still dominated by Liberals, it certainly made no effort to 'keep the Government honest'. Just the opposite.
Jon Oliver on Last Week Tonight had an excellent piece on the folly of mandatory minimum jail sentences in the US.
Same deal, they tell us what is going to happen with some fantasy. The .nuts part was nice though Booger.
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford 'very surprised' by friend's drug charges woot woot....
and your science degree is from where.....the bible???
Just not an affordable one. Let them eat cake.
Unbelievable. The Globe continues to decline as a reputable news outlet. It's been sliding for years but deleting this comment takes the cake. Time to cancel my subscription.
Way to read the headline and give us your two cent knee-jerk response.
How good is Sheila's French? Just joking.
Justin Trudeau Pollwww. AngusReidForum.comWill Justin Trudeau be the next PM? Angus Reid wants your opinion, nowYes 39%No. 60%
Yup - Harper's cronies are the winners and citizens are the losers.
Wait! There's cake too??
No. But sometimes adults are so cynical, greedy, idealogical and hateful, that they refuse empirical evidence and have to somehow be retaught as if they were in elementary school.
Sure, American is racist to the core and every other country in the world has known nothing but peace and equality for centuries.
Baby Trudeau wants to be like Daddy Trudeau and people are fed up with it. He keeps up his nonsense he will be a one term wonder.
Jailed more like it.
Sendergreen, thanks for supporting my previous post, now what are the little voices in your head saying.....
Maybe he could hire a temporary foreign soul.
What is the price of a 4 litre bottle of milk today in Canada? Last time I checked it was $7.60; which seems pretty high to this Canadian consumer.
Give your time to the poor, but never give your money to the church.
Hugh. you do more to advertise for gay rights than you imagine.
The so-called killing for conservation, is nothing more than window dressing for killing for sport and inhumane glory.
You new around here? Mr. 'Sharp's views aren't exactly held in high regard.
You waste your hard earned money on this drivel ?
What would be the advantage to having a Foreign Affairs Minister who was a thinker? 'To be, or not to be. That is the question' You prefer that kind of Foreign Affairs Minister?
hey K....I'd say that Mr Harper has scored well in the eyes of Canadians... on the manner he handled that 'hunger striking' chief... who had a cadilac on a reserve with just 4 km of road... while her fellow FN reserve members lived in squallor
Southey is pure genius. And Mackay... is not.
Tim. It will deprive ISIS of the base it currently holds.
when speaking about people like the clintons, nasty is simply being kind
Margaret shush. The Government will hear.
For Pete's sake, instead of making a big deal out of the National Anthem's words, why don't we just bring back God Save the Queen or the Maple Leaf Forever?
How does Ms. Wente segue from the very important topic of childhood vaccinations to energy? California must have a law that requires pupils to be immunized against polio, whooping cough and the like?
Should we ask for teachers to be better at teaching math?
Still though, I said it in another article on this subject, although then I said it jokingly. Little did I know it really would cue up the hysterics
In the long tradition of diplomacy on foreign missions Mr Harper handed out souvenirs of Canada, very generously giving everyone he met a Rob Ford fridge magnet.
Trudeau had the idea....but Mulroney made it the law...
Proof? Are you blind? The apartheid state will be stopped. No doubt about it. Unfortunately as things "Israeli" go Canada is catching the disease.
Many parents are not so wise as your godson's. They believe that immunisations cause autism for example
thanks for the laughs ...
Moral of the story: the federal Tories can drop to 25% and still garner a majority government.
bob rae will roll if NDP gains power.
Trump will never be elected.
No thank you.
Watch and see.
The Tory party needs to lose it's criminally corrupt status, could be a reason why Mr Mulcair is seen as a viable alternative.
Careful, your partisanship is showing....
Scrimbo, the 'reviewed by moderator' for each and every Margaret Wente has been going on since Fall 2012.
Nature abhors a vacuum. If that vacuum occurs in the rule of law , sooner or later it will be filled. But this time with vigilantism.
What a racist rant Glenn.
Not one word in this article about Subban going to arbitration with the Habs. Rae is hiding something.
'Because us girls only go to university to get our Mrs. degrees!'Based on the article it seems as though education is harmful to less educated women, because they will find it harder to compete with more educated women for a husband. Awesome.
Does Palestine have a right to exist? Does it have a right to defend itself?
Ah, but according to the anti-liberals the polls are biased, ask leading questions, etc. All of them! Facts only count if they agree with their prejudices.
S.H.: it isn't really high on our radar
The Clinton campaign fell into the same train of thought, labelling ALL opponents as nasty folks.
yes we must be biased because we disagree with her... same old same old nonsense
Oh come on. You have to dig deep into the well of political correctness to equate Islamic intolerance of dissenting opinions with opposition to the "right" of abortion. Apologist nonsense.
... or do what the previous commentator did!
sort of like having a clinic on safe sex but are find for distribution porn when you advertize the clinic.......
you have no idea, what's your point ?
If government and drug companies wont accept liability for their products then why would we trust them?
try breathing in a garage full of CO2 and see what happens.
Every parasite needs a host.
Tiara - is that a tinfoil tiara you're wearing, or not?
You are just silly. Not a word of what you said has any merit.
I see the Globe and Mail censors have deleted my comment despite the huge positive ranking it received. Appears reason is lost to them and faith is more important. Think I'll cancel my subscription.
Wrong. I am fully correct. I am also witness to it all.
His question is intended to stir up anti-Muslim bias - as always.
They have presented their game plan. If you're too lazy to go read it, that's hardly Hudak's fault.
BANG-ON! Christy Clarke and her gang of thieves should be shouting bloody murder to the Federal and Quebec Governments to end the useless and self-serving Immigrant Investor Programs.
Hyper sexualization is how you and I got here in the first place. It's why we have been so successful as a species.
Little Rock seems to have lots of idle time.
PMO SCANDAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bob, you may be from Calgary or Edmonton, but you speak for most of us. Thank you and rock on.
You gave yourself away when you admitted you watched the CBC. You will never find a balanced point of view there. They are all in the Liberal, Green, left wing persuasion and you are paying for this to be spread accrosss Canada.
Time for the elders and chiefs to stand up to the plate and take a leadership role!
A job in retail - to raise a family on ??In your dreams ! Never ....
Alberta is waiting for money transfers from other part of Canada. NDP first step to make Alberta poor.
Try reading one of the many excellent books on the history of oppression of people under communist regimes and reflect privately Will China be front and centre as an oppressor? It's a terrible idea. What next, a monument to the victims of bullying!
Complete nonsense.
Sometimes precise details are forgotten for a purpose.
Good points!
The US ought to check Comey's bank account.
This reads like a third-rate undergrad paper in a social studies course. Please G and M, if you are to inflict opinion on us instead of news, find someone who has something original to say.
It is tiresome and sickening to most Torontonians. Has been for a long time.
On the contrary, Mr. Trudeau would be very welcome by most world leaders. It is the Harper gov't that has put Canada on the cringe-worthy status among world leaders; except maybe for Assad who I am sure welcomes the help Harper offers.
A racial divide under Obama is not surprising to me at all. To many it's just not right to have a black man sit in the White House, even so he is half while. It is sad to say the least, but that is America.
The purpose of secular democracy is to allow people to worship and observe their religious practices in freedom without oppression from a central religion, or from religion-haters such as yourself. Please go read some Thomas Jefferson.
PMO office have a hand in this?
I can see why you chose your screen name.
don't hold your breath
BA's and MBA's were thought to give a person an advantage in the past but they were deemed to be of little value then except in getting you in the door. The employer assumed it taught you how to learn, a fundamental error.
Yeah and fed up with how your parents and teachers taught you to live, how the Church tells you how to live and all the organizations and media outlets who talk about outdated concepts like civility and morality.
Thats why they have declined so much and live in little tiny houses with little tiny rooms.
another useless article by a lefty.
Why don't the Liberal party members elected to parliament who supported this initiative step up to the plate and take in Syrian families - it is hypocritical to ask other people to do something which you yourself do not want to do.

They still use slave labor in Dubai.. but hey... as long as you're making a lot of money..... stand up proud...
Justin is like an eager school boy wanting to show his masters how obedient he is.
Its a good thing electricity is already invented, because if someone try to come with it these days it would create protests from scientifically illiterate fear mongers, just like hydraulic fracturing does.
Every new innovation in teaching math is only to make teach math easier for the teacher, even if not necessarily more informative for the students. Going back to memorization and drill methods is more work for teachers, and thus forbidden as Rote.
Early in Margaret's piece she mentioned that these 'unhinged' people hooked onto a toxic ideology. That toxin is present and spreading in every Western country.
My counter argument to this ridiculous article written by someone who clearly knows nothing about sports: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jJ0wlA2R80
Pause, there's a very simple reason that the people supporting the CBC want it funded by the taxpayer. They don't want to support it themselves and want someone else to do it for them.
I don't want the person who rewires my house to have a low IQ, either
Indeed and as some news surrounding social housing and it's bypassing those waiting lists to accommodate refugees (and maybe in some cases new immigrants..) There could be some hard feelings there.. or even potential trouble down the road.
You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. And boy, is there ever a lot of lipstick on that pig! And rouge... And foundation... And hairspray. Even Carrot Top points at Harpo and laughs.
As,in the case of Richard Nixon; it's an honour to be on this enemy's list.
HH, it's true we did but only because the alternative, Mr. Hudak, was unthinkable (and unthinking). If the PCs had put forward an acceptable candidate, the Libs would have been long gone.
I love the term 'dominionist base' used in your comment. It just sounds so old-school. I might have thought of calling it his 'monarchist base' but the word 'dominionist' is so much more encompassing.
Even if you die, the money remaining goes to the govt, am i right?
Um, Bunny - you might want to educate yourself on Kenney's pandering to the suburban Muslim vote before throwing around epithets against other political parties.
Yet you have no time for the climate scientists who are telling you that this is, in fact, a wealth redistribution scheme by western apologists.
And that means?
Canada would be far poorer without the Americans who sought refuge here during the Vietnam war and stayed. Lovely column with a deft touch of humour.
If industry Amy's for it, it will surely be biased. I support the government paying for it but not doing the research itself. Contract it to universities then bill the cost back to producers as part of any permitting cost.
If you want to compete with American farmers, yes it will. A lot more.
Great article. If only we can keep the religious people out of the argument (e.g., Catholic Church), then we can have an adult discussion.
If you don't think almost all our good journalists are in Quebec, then just listen to the questioning after a Harper and/or Reform/Con news conference. English Canadian journalism have been neutered.
It will take a politician with massive balls to fight these public sector unions.
Trudeau's somewhat lame 'joke' is much ado about nothing. Harper's brand of partisan politics is toxic. Time for him to go.
I think Alberta is a pretty good sign that people are voting their gut and not just a party line.
This was all written before Kevin O'Leary decided to get into politics. I'm sure he'll get us all back on track in no time :)
Rick, we may not be in love with Saudi Arabia but it is an ally against a common enemy which is Iran in war you find whatever ally you can
Canadians don't know why we are at war. Mr. Harper knows why he has Canadians at war. It will win him an election unless Mulcair and Trudeau get their $4!t together.
Why would you want to put a lunatic criminal on our money ?
Questioning the actions of Israel hardly makes one an anti-Semite or a Hamas supporter. Don't be ridiculous.
Best benefits. Obviously. http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33268521
... because you do not want to know that 70% of Canadians HATE Harper and his bigoted minions !
Am I really permitted to say that? What's a poster like me doing on a thread like this? LOL
Wait... there's a ferry to Rochester?!! What will they think of next... an over-budget, over-delayed subway extension to York University?!!
Seal off the area, charge them with whatever laws they are breaking, seize property equivalent to the tax they owe and be done with it. If I have a grievance and occupy city hall, will I just be ignored and allowed to go about my life?
So, the end justifies the means, does it? Are there any 'means' that to which you would object if the 'end' is to fight terrorism?
Well said. Our time will come, and Canada will need its own Trump.
How's your joke Presidential candidate doing ?
Huh? Please explain how your non-American spouse '... risks being consider a U.S. Person by the U. S. government ...'
No one's freaking out. The manifesto is lame and going nowhere.
Remote application by who?
So any country that isn't up to our virtuous Canadian standards should be set right. Let's see... that means... the rest of the world. Okay, Bob, we'll get right on it.
This article is nothing but a mutual belly rubbing back slapping service for the well off. When is the G&M going to write about tax evasion, in places like the Grand Caymans?
What an utter waste of time and money that would be.
Which is why the Conservatives and Repbulicans have kept evangelical Christians out of their ranks, right? Why they have stopped opposing abortion? Why they have stopped opposing same-sex marriage? Yeah, "politics and religion don't mix".
Only in Canada would a 'Ketchup War' make the media headlines .-)
Not at all. The issue is they; re not too sharp and don't listen anyway.
Airvault, Four degrees? So you were a professional student, then. I see why you went on to a Union job. C.
Keep up the good work Mr. Kenney !
'So Trudeau smoked pot. At least he?s honest'----------But if Harper said the very same thing, the Globe and Mail headline would read:'So Harper smoked pot. What else has he lied to us about?'
rhet?o?ric: 'language designed to have a persuasive or impressive effect on its audience, but often regarded as lacking in sincerity or meaningful content.'
In typical Globe and Mail fashion, nobody takes credit for this piece of crap article. Whitey is very afraid, and rightly so.
Without the Hard power to back up Rhetoric no one would listen anyway.
Your knuckles are dragging again Jack.
You miss the entire point of the article and seem to want to besmirch any female leader you believe is on the left. Yours is a political, anti-female leader rant.
The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.-- Winston Churchill

93 was a good year too
Didn't we have this discussion in CMV like, 2 days ago? If that? If hot dogs are sandwiches, then burgers damn well are too.
Hey, if this God fella really existed, and he really wanted his children to do something or not do something else, wouldn't he just tell us clearly what he wanted?
Refreshing analysis and important column. There are days like this one when I don't regret having a Globe and Mail subscription (wish to experience them more often...).
And RRSPs, TFSAs, pension plans, etc. There should be no such thing as a tax break. They transfer money from all taxpayers to a smaller number of taxpayers, with most going to people with money.
Thanks for this. Opposition to Alberta oil pipelines by the Rest of Canada, effectively resulting in a regulatory blockade of our primary export product, is hitting a raw nerve out here like never before.
You are paying too much attanetion to the loones
nothing involving the arts survives in Vancouver... Vancouverites care about real estate and the only place they go to is costco
Oh stop it with your accuracy, the editorial is much better with the writers' made up facts...
Right , so how is that Venezuela plan working?
What issues, George?
Not sure in what universe a school teacher is worth more than a good plumber,
It is a straightforward biological fact that human life begins at conception.
I gave you thumbs-up. You are absolutely right.
The G&M is up to its ears in conflict of interest when it comes to a discussion on government advertising.
Maybe The Salvation Army's anti-gay theology and history of anti-gay actions is the reason that Ms. Wente left them off the list: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zinnia-jones/the-salvation-armys-histo_b_4422938.html
If you look at this morning's National Post, Harper was in 3rd place. If you think you are getting back in, start packing. Get to 24 Sussex and help them also.
Who told you that there are no unions? What cheap labor. Minimum wage is way higher than Canada. Please don't make statements if you don't know what you are talking about!
Her email problems shows just how weak and out of touch she is.
Yes they will pay the lawyers in the class action suits, they will pay the healthy severance for the execs who lose their jobs and they will pay government fines - the VW owners will get next to nothing
Harper will protect us from command control in the cupboard.
RSPs can be rolled over tax free to certain family members.
I did not use bad language . You consider my comments unfounded. You sure as heck didn't investigate MS, Wentes comments as to whether they were unfounded!!
Carbon Tax is a joke. We need to protect our planet by developing an economy that does not rely on unlimited growth. Increasing our population will lead us to what we are trying to prevent.
Please post something relevant.
R. Hebner. Canada does indeed have a seat at the UN. Just not a toothless temporary seat at the Security Council.
Another stinker from The Worst Columnist in Canada (tm).
Cancer is much more pressing and yet lacks a certain cache.
Wow! Jeffrey Simpson and Ezra Levant are on the same page.
You are reading the G&M. This is a conservative mouthpiece- didn't you notice?
A good point.
Or there's a third option, when they act like good boys. Yes, there are some! Just as there are bad girls. It comes down to choices the individual makes, there are 500 choices often. (there's a course on that).
Don't feel bad for Bernie Sanders, integrity and democratic ideas are comfort. Feel bad for the Democratic party. It has been losing its way...
Yeah, we need George W. Bush back to get the country back on track with his shrewd fiscal policies.
The article said the world's a better place, not a perfect place.

I should add RBN, .. you have nothing to fear but fear itself. Btw...if i were retired in NS, i'd be golfing at either Yarmouth or Clare tomorrow, weather permitting.
Since we're being literal, it's right there, next to "faith".
Probably because he was comparing two provicncial governements as the article focuses on the Alberta government. This is not a discussion abput Federal politics although obviously you are incapable of grasping that concept.
